                    <td><p>The book &#8220;Love and Sex with Robots&#8221;, published by British artificial intelligence expert David Levy in 2007, predicts that by 2050, humans will have a close relationship with robots. It&#8217;s just sex, love, friendship and marriage. Ian Pearson, a futurist who boasted a prediction accuracy rate of 85%, went further, predicting that by 2050, humans and sex doll will have more love than humans. The sex toy industry has an annual output value of 15 billion yuan, and with the rise of high-tech products such as virtual reality porn and remote sex, the industry&#8217;s prospects are even more promising. Pearson believes that by 2025, women will prefer to have sex with love doll rather than men. Harvard professor Cathy O&#8217;Neil even thinks that real men will gradually be eliminated. She said that in the future, robots can help with cleaning, washing dishes, doing housework, and provide love and sex. Therefore, women in the future are likely to prefer to stay with robots rather than real men.<br />

Noel Sharkey, one of the founders of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, agrees with Richardson, saying that the issue seems to be gender neutral, but in fact, buying Japanese sex doll of women are still a minority and the entire market is still driven by men&#8217;s sexuality. Consumers can arbitrarily and selectively love the appearance and personality of robots, and robots cannot refuse to have sex with users. These characteristics make the phenomenon of materialized women more serious, distort the perception of desirable sexual behavior, and make illegal sexual acts (such as sexual intercourse with children ) Seems to be legal.<br />

However, host and sex columnist Karley Sciortino of Viceland&#8217;s &#8220;Slutever&#8221; show had &#8220;practical experience&#8221; of going to bed with robots. She accepted an invitation from another sex doll company, Sinthetics, and experienced 20 minutes of sex with &#8220;Gabriel&#8221;. Gabriel ’s name has the meaning of “revenge angel”. It is about 5 feet 9 inches in length. It can be customized for organ size. It also has pubic hair, which has a high degree of simulation. The yang has two states: soft and strong. Sometimes the body will also add some scars or freckles to make the doll more humane, each priced at 6,700 yuan.</p>
