<span class="caps">LAS</span> <span class="caps">VEGAS</span> &#8211; Almost a year after debuting on Kickstarter, the PonoPlayer is on sale and the company has shown it at the electronics fair <span class="caps">CES</span> 2015.</p>
<p>The PonoPlayer is one of a new batch of players offer a high fidelity sound resolution &#8220;greater than CD&#8221;, with models like the Cowon Plenue 1 and the Sony ZX2, which was announced at the <span class="caps">CES</span> 2015 . The difference is in the price: although most high end players cost about US $ 1,000 the PonoPlayer costs a few &#8220;affordable&#8221; US $ 400.</p>

In a world of iPod clones, the PonoPlayer&#8217;s design stands out. It is a small device that measures 5 inches tall by 2 inches wide and one inch deep. It has a triangular shape that recreates the iRiver T60 and T50, and the company claims that the design allows it to include a larger and efficient cylindrical battery of 2,950 milliamps</p>
<p>Although usually referred to as &#8220;Pono,&#8221; this device devised by Neil Young consists of two different platforms: the PonoPlayer player and the PonoMusic Internet store, which sells high fidelity recordings by artists such as Foo Fighters, Taylor Swift and Neil Young, As well as the player, whose orders will begin shipping in February 2015. After some initial delays, Pono says initial Kickstarter orders are already satisfied.</p>

Although &#8220;MP3 player&#8221; may sound like an insult to the music enthusiast community in high fidelity, it is an accurate description of the PonoPlayer. Although it plays high-resolution music (24-bit / 192kHz), it supports <span class="caps">FLAC</span>, <span class="caps">ALAC</span>, MP3, <span class="caps">WAV</span>, <span class="caps">AIFF</span> and <span class="caps">AAC</span> formats, which most other MP3 players can play.</p>
<p>Although the design has a certain style of the past, the PonoPlayer is not a retro device. It has a touch screen and 128GB of space (64GB built-in and a slot for a 64GB microSD card). Interestingly, the player also has a light that tells you when you hear a &#8220;PonoMusic certified song,&#8221; but it is unclear what this means, perhaps it identifies a 24-bit file?</p>
<p>PonoMusic says it could include the best audio components &#8220;without compromising anything&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although Neil Young initially announced that he was working with Meridian to develop the player, it appears that he did eventually with Ayre Acoustics. According to Digital Audio Review, the player has a <span class="caps">DCA</span> <span class="caps">ESS</span> Saber 9018, the same as the high-end Oppo <span class="caps">BDP</span>-105 player. The device has two outputs: one for headphones and the other for use with a traditional hi-fi system.</p>

PonoMusic<br />
Although the standard player is offered in black or yellow, those who contributed to Kickstarter were able to tap into limited-edition models with artists such as Willie Nelson, Arcade Fire and, of course, Young himself.</p>
<p>The device is synchronized via a Micro-<span class="caps">USB</span> connection to the PonoMusic World app for PC and Mac. The app allows users to organize their music and buy new tracks from the store on the Internet in 24-bit <span class="caps">FLAC</span> format.</p>
<p>The perspective<br />
Although it is difficult to predict whether the PonoPlayer will be a long-term success, personally I think this small device could be a Trojan horse in the same sense as inkjet printers or game consoles: it gives the consumer a relatively Cheap to spend big on inputs. If Neil Young and his allies manage to convince record companies to carefully produce &#8220;exclusive&#8221; digital music for PonoMusic, I think there will be people willing to spend money on music alone, no matter what player they have.</p>
<p>Many companies, including Sony, Samsung and <span class="caps">DTS</span>, are counting on high-resolution music to become popular, as a way to sell high-fidelity devices, and with personalities like Neil Young helping them, it may be.</p></td>
