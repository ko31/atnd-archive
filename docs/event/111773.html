                    <td><p>SolidWorks&nbsp;is a computer-aided design software which is used to perform tasks on design. Automotive industries implement SolidWorks&nbsp;when structuring or planning a design of a car or an automotive part. SolidWorks&nbsp;accepts input from users, analyse it and applies artificial intelligence (AI) to generate the desired output. Engineers often use this technology to help them come with better designs and redesigning a project. The use of SolidWorks&nbsp;is not just limited to construction and automobile. Its aptness in design can also be employed in mechanical and aerospace technology.</p>
<p>SolidWorks&nbsp;has also earned its fame as computer-aided engineering (<span class="caps">CAE</span>). It is developed with an intention to run on windows operating system. Dassault System first generated and released SolidWorks. Information about SolidWorks&nbsp;can also be availed by online SolidWorks&nbsp;assignment help.</p>
