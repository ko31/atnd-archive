Others remember searching for eggs and candy, then tearing into an Easter basket brimming with treats. Christians give thanks for the resurrection of Christ, while others look forward to the daffodils and crocus’ to appear. Whatever your memories, Easter is a time of renewal and awakening. Here are some examples of hopeful thoughts to share with those who join you in celebrating Easter and the arrival of Spring.<br />
Warm Easter Wishes.</p>

An Easter Poem For You: Spring has sprung, the grass has riz, I wish I were in the chocolate biz! Happy Easter.<br/><br/><br/>
If it weren’t for the beautiful Spring weather, I’d be really upset with that damn bunny for eating all my flower bulbs. Happy Easter anyway.<br/><br/><br/>
Happy Easter to you and your family as we celebrate our Father’s greatest sacrifice through his Son, Jesus Christ. Have a blessed Easter.<br/><br/><br/>
I love Easter. It’s a time for eating all the chocolate you can find with complete impunity! Have a delicious Easter.<br/><br/><br/>
Lavender plaid, pinks and pastels everywhere, sun shining and blue skies… It’s almost like being on a golf course in South Florida! Happy Easter.<br/><br/>
We tolerate a little Spring rain in order to enjoy the sunshine that follows. It’s just like we tolerate a little heartburn in order to enjoy copious amounts of Easter candy! Enjoy!<br/><br/><br/>
All we got to do is follow Christ, for in Christ will all our queries be solved. Have a Blessed and Meaningful Easter.
<p><br/>
<br/></p>
Be thankful because Jesus gave us another chance to be a good person. His death cleansed us from our sins.<br/><br/><br/>
Celebrate this Easter with a heart filled with love and peace. Have a blessed and wonderful Easter!<br/><br/><br/>
Christ is risen. Hallelujah! May the miracle of Easter bring you renewed hope, faith, love and joy.<br/><br/><br/>
Easter brings fun, Easter bring Happiness, Easter brings God’s endless blessings, Easter brings love and the freshness of spring. Happy Easter to you and your family!<br/><br/><br/>
Easter brings God Endless Blessings, Easter brings fresh love… Happy Easter to You, with all best wishes!<br/><br/><br/>
The risen Christ is celebrated in every opened flower, in every beam of nourishing sunlight, in every humble patch of green beneath our feet. Easter blessings.<br/></td>
