                    <td><p>Commit the end of September, the firm has introduced another way of aiding the students across the Australian sub-continent. It has planned to make available a discount to the students by slashing down the prices by half. Even the top universities have often been criticised for giving away lumps of assignments to the students. To better accommodate such an issue and help the victimised students at the least possible prices, they have come up with this idea delivering social service and HD assignments simultaneously. This makes them a lot more than just the best <a href="https://www.myassignmentservices.com/">online assignment help</a> service provider. <br />
The company has been in the industry for over a decade. Since then, it has been helping students with assignments using the expertise their experts own. In light of this activity, the company’s spokesperson said in a press conference, “We could have chosen to double our prices. It would have been great for our business. Doubling the prices right before the commencement of examinations, when the assignments brim in, could have tripled our revenue. But, again, that’s not like us. We are thee to help. Not fool the students”. <br />
For the students, this is the time when they start recalling all the assignments and have them all on the table. Just the thought of that pulls them down. Introducing the discount is a great initiative taken by My Assignment Services. Bringing about a change in the modules of top universities undoubtedly takes time. For now, communicating them that this is the concern of almost every student they teach shall suffice. Other than this, there shall be more companies offering similar or higher discounts.<br />
The firms in this industry shall first be humane, before business minded entities. The services offered by the firm being talked about are one of a kind. The discount can be availed of by any local Australian student and international student as well. Since the discount will soon become live on their website, inviting in a lot of traffic, one shall not hesitate but wonder if they would be able to match the quality standards they have maintained over the past decade. Often quantity suppresses quality, so that shall be a point to investigate. However, the company’s <span class="caps">CEO</span> has reassured the students that the quality would not be played with. <br />
A student, who wishes to get his/her assignments done by academic experts, the period between 27th and 29th of September this year could prove the best time to seek assignments online. The organisation has made its bit count by offering a gift to the students. The discount may be availed of on any of their services. Dissertations, Essays, Reports, Thesis, CDRs, PPTs, et cetera regarding subjects including the likes of Economics, Accounts, IT, Law, Engineering, Marketing, Management, and many more under Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD could be brought to one’s convenience. <br />
A few characteristics of their quality include plagiarism free work, timely delivery, etc. another aspect is their Value-Added Services. They provide –<br />
•	Turnitin Reports<br />
•	Live One-On-One video session with experts<br />
•	Proofreading<br />
•	Editing<br />
•	Quality check<br />
•	Consultation with expert<br />
Anyone who had been piling up the assignments, now is the time to keep half the pre-sought price in hand and still get assignments done with Highest Distinction in every assignment. <br />
