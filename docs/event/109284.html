<p>Survey present us the opportunity to hear independent and impartial view from a professional’s, we can&#8217;t know the market situation well unless we are engaged in the related job, only an expert who have experience and up to date knowledge about the thing prevailing in the market can estimate the potential issues in the housing market and tell us what is best for us, whether to go with the transaction or not.</p>
<p>Only an expert know how to do their field job in the best way, that’s why we sometime suggest for availing professionals help for your move like when you have lot to move, have less time extra “difficult to handle situations” when preparing for move, rather than putting your possession at the risk its better to avail the help of experts like Movers and Packers Dulawat Gurgaon.</p>
<p>Are You Sure About The Valuation?</p>
<p>Mortgage valuation and property survey both are very different concept, which people mostly thing are the same, just because both are requested for property valuation, that doesn’t mean both are the same thing.  Mortgage valuation is for the lenders benefit so they can get an idea whether property is safe to lend upon or not, but when you go for private survey the surveyor will look into every matter irrespective of the lender, and that&#8217;s how you can know about the potential defect’s or any structure concern related to the purchase.</p>

<p>Power Of Negotiation:</p>
<p>By chance if through a survey you catch some deformity and issues in the condition of the property, then you can use that report to negotiate with the seller regarding the property price. That’s why hiring a expert surveyor is must so you can get the strong points, in such case seller will follow two option either to reduce the price of the property which we can use to overcome the issues and deformity or to carry out the same renovation prior of your move.</p>
