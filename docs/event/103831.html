<p>My Assignment Services makes history by once again launching an assignment help offer like none other and doing assignments for A$1.</p>
<p>My Assignment Services launches yet another offer like no other where they have decided that the assignments will be done for only A$1. Yes, that is right. For an unbelievable price of one dollar! The credit of this out of the box assignment help offer is being given to the students and their queries for a reliable and cheap assignment writing service.<br />
Jack Daniels, the brain behind this <a href="https://www.myassignmentservices.com/">assignment help</a> offer says, &#8220;We have received countless queries from the students saying that our service is exemplary and reliable. But we need to bring down the price a teeny tiny bit from what we are asking. So we thought to ourselves what would be the best way of making the wish of the students true and also keeping the business running delivering what we are known for. Then the idea of this A$1 assignment help offer was born. After several meetings and inputs from different people, we gave this idea shape and implemented it to successful action. I just hope that the students get what they want and this sale gives us what we want.&#8221; Jack has worked for and implemented many successful assignment help offers by My Assignment Services in the past.</p>
<p>The students are not less excited hearing this offer. And today, My Assignment Services have revealed the date of this amazing offer. This offer of the century will be launched and made live for every student on 4 February 2019. &#8220;I was waiting eagerly for the customer executives to reveal the date of this sale and now that the revelation has been finally made, I cannot keep calm&#8221;, says Kaitlin Moore, a psychology student at the University of Adelaide.<br />
“There is no other assignment help provider out there who brings out offers like My Assignment Services do. The first assignment I got done under their First 500 Words Free scheme and now they are bringing out A$1 scheme. I have lined up my assignments and collected my friends’ too.”, an excited Wakabi Al-Habib, a mechanical engineering student at the Monash University says.</p>
<p>The offer by My Assignment Services is receiving a critical review from their competitors as well as the students. To avail of this offer, the students have to order two assignments simultaneously with the organisation. These two assignments can be of the same student or different students. Once the order is placed, the first assignment will be done at the base price that will be charged for any assignment help service. The base price of assignments is set at A$99. Once the student makes the payment and gets the assignment confirmation, he/she can place the second order which will be done for only A$1. , in a nutshell, the students can get 2 assignments for only A$100. However, this offer cannot be clubbed with other offers. Also, if you order only one assignment, you would need to pay the full base price as defined by the organisation.</p>
