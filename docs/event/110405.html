After not too long of production practice, the operation of domestic continuous flat-press scorching presses has reached the international advanced level. The continuous flat pressure creation line has obvious advantages in producing <span class="caps">MDF</span> having a thickness of 4~15 mm.<br><cite>??When selecting a continuous flat force hot press, you should focus on:<br>?</cite>?(1) According to the main direction from the enterprise product, the main parameters on the press should be determined. The production line of the main production sheet should be a shorter press length including a faster production speed; the presses with medium and thick plates need to be compared. The length of the actual press is relatively low, along with the production speed is relatively small. It is not required to need a press to produce a plate using a thickness of 2 to 27 mm. The width of the press must be selected from 4&#8217; to 9&#8217; as outlined by the specifications of the supplement.<br><cite>??(2) The structure of the inlet platen from the continuous flat press is pretty critical. Although the pre-press includes compacted the slab, there holds air in the slab, as well as the slab is exhausted so which the slab is not vented. The tiny fiber mass is caused to fall about the steel strip, which requires a unique press plate inlet structure. Imported presses have his or her patented technology to solve this problem, and domestic presses also have their unique patented technology. For example, the Shanghai plate machine ongoing press adopts the flexible adjustment technology belonging to the inlet bending platen, which can automatically adjust the opening penetration of the inlet and the curved surface on the platen according to the thickness detection data on the pre-pressed slab. The supporting hydraulic procedure adopts the servo control program, and the technology is extremely advanced. Yalian Machinery&#8217;s continuous press uses a highly flexible inlet structure and constant pressure hot plate with the production of thin and decreased density sheets.<br>?</cite>?(3) According towards requirements of the hot pushing curve, the frame and your oil cylinder are divided into several sections, and each section has a set of thermal oil extra circulation system, and each product is designed according to the warming requirement. The first and second parts are high temperature and high pressure sections, which are the sections while using most heat consumption during the main pressing process. Therefore, the design from the secondary circulation system of this section should fully obtain the requirements of different plate types and different specifications belonging to the pressing process. The suppression of special plates along with the increase in production leave some heat supply.<br><cite>??(4) The structure of the chain as well as the roller rod and the bolt is essential. It must be reliable plus easy to disassemble and exchange. The cleaning and lubrication program directly affects the service life on the roller rod and the bolt. The actual bolt structure of Yalian Devices has advanced technology. Reliable use will be the company&#8217;s patented technology.<br>?</cite>?(5) The hydraulic system from the cylinder can adopt the proportional valve system as well as open-close valve system, each which has its own characteristics, however it is better to use the proportional valve system within the high pressure section and the actual opening and closing valve technique in other areas.<br><cite>??(6) The press belt is the most important and valuable wearing part. Even though the press designer considers a compilation of measures to protect the metallic strip, it will cause damage due to various reasons during its surgery. In addition to the preservation and operation level, the life of the steel strip depends on the specifications in the products that are often manufactured. The long-term high-speed production of thin sheets boosts the possibility of damage to the particular steel strip. The smoothness of the steel strip on the continuous flat-press hot press directly affects the surface from the sheet, especially when producing calenders (non-sanded sheets), double-polished steel strips must be selected. The thickness of the metal strip is determined by along the press. The author believes that the thickness of the steel strip is not really as thick as possible. The particular thicker the steel strip, the larger the diameter from the drive roller, otherwise the time for fatigue cracking shall be advanced, and the service life belonging to the steel strip will be state-of-the-art. It will be shortened, so the thickness of this steel strip used under the length of the press is 2. 7mm.<br>?</cite>?(7) The pressure on the continuous flat press is higher. When using the heat transfer oil, try to choose a trusted synthetic heat transfer oil, and usually do not use mineral heat transfer oil.<br>????(8) Pay attention to the look of the upper steel remove return seal cover. The cover not only has the protection function, the actual closed waste steam, but furthermore the heat preservation function. The lower the return temperature from the steel strip is, the superior.<br><a href="https://www.chinachangxing.com/Hot-Press-Machine-pl6520806.html">https://www.chinachangxing.com/Hot-Press-Machine-pl6520806.html</a></p>
