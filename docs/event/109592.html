S. cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) for that 900MW fifth phase involving Dubai’s Mohammed bin Rashid &#8217;s Maktoum (<span class="caps">MBR</span>) Solar Store, according to a report through the Middle East Economic Break down. That sets a brand-new record for unsubsidized energy PV production, in the region no less than. However, it is still a little way short of this 1. 654 cents/kWh achieved in Portugal earlier this year.<br><br>The Dubai authorities include delighted in repeatedly setting new records for previous phases in the <span class="caps">MBR</span> Solar Park and they could be disappointed to have fallen just short this time. A carefully-worded statement through the government-owned utility, <span class="caps">DEWA</span>, previously this week claimed they had, however, set a different world record for the PV solar plant determined by the independent power producer (<span class="caps">IPP</span>) model.<br><br>The <span class="caps">MBR</span> Solar Park is designed to be the largest single-site solar power facility on the planet and will have an overall total capacity of 5GW simply by 2030. It is only four years because it was set up, but its short history shows exactly how quickly solar energy costs have tumbled.<br><br>In 2015 the very first phase of the surgery center was launched, with a 200MW <span class="caps">ENERGY</span> solar plant developed for any then-record tariff of <span class="caps">SOME</span>. 85 cents/kWh. A new record was set with the second, 200MW phase in 5. 6 cents/kWh. With June 2016, that benchmark was beaten to the 800MW third phase, having a price of 2. 99 cents/kWh – before a solar project had consist of under 3 cents/kWh.<br><a href="https://www.sunpower-solar.com/products/pressurized+solar+water+heater.html">https://www.sunpower-solar.com/products/pressurized+solar+water+heater.html</a> <br></p></td>
