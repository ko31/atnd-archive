<p>This conference will review EU legislation, examine procedures and data requirements, and discuss to what exactly extent <span class="caps">EFSA</span>-compliant data may be used to achieve approvals in China plus the <span class="caps">USA</span> (or vice versa). Re-evaluation because of the EU of around 400 feed additives started this year and the EU is definitely systematically prohibiting feed additives that no re-evaluation dossier had been submitted, or which flunk the European Food Safety Authority&#8217;s (<span class="caps">EFSA</span>) scrutiny. A different feed regulation, the feed material register and also the catalogue of feed materials have improved transparency around feed labelling, while allowing for some physiological and sensible claims.</p>
<p>Depending on planned use, the US <span class="caps">FDA</span> may regulate a product or service added to animal feed as the drug or a nourish ingredient. In either scenario, the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act requires the sponsor to get <span class="caps">FDA</span> approval or <span class="caps">GRAS</span> recognition before marketing. In the over, <span class="caps">FDA</span> has followed coverage of enforcement discretion to let marketing of unapproved products if evaluated from the <span class="caps">AAFCO</span> feed ingredient definition process and listed in the Official Publication. The <span class="caps">FDA</span> now encourages sponsors to make use of the food additive petition process of new products. The Offshore Ministry of Agriculture introduced new guidance and laws on feed additives, adopting some issues with EU/<span class="caps">EFSA</span>, other aspects involving <span class="caps">USA</span> <span class="caps">FDA</span>, and some uniquely Chinese approaches while in the area of animal diet.</p>
<p>For these reasons quite a few companies manufacturing or marketing feed additives prefer to address, as far as they can, the regulatory requirements of EU, Chinese and US authorities in one project. As part of your conference, informal workshops will enable delegates to figure together to solve regulatory problems.</p>
