                    <td><p>The most important application of <span class="caps">PVC</span> is in the construction industry, which is mainly used being a drain pipe, rainwater pipe and threading pipe within the construction industry. What is the current state in the market for using an array of <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe fittings? The following content will say.<br><br><br><br>main：<br><br><br>Industry Status<br><br><span class="caps">PVC</span> water line fitting analysis<br><br>Market research<br><br><br><br>Market Status<br><br><br><span class="caps">PVC</span> raw materials come from a wide range of sources, low prices, many family manufacturers can supply <span class="caps">PVC</span> raw materials, and the price is just not affected by the international essential oil price, <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe production line is a growing number of advanced, high-speed production lines, one out three, one out 4 production lines, etc.,greatly minimized The production cost has improved the production efficiency, and that domestic <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe fittings sector is highly competitive. Some manufacturers have not also considered the product quality so that they can reduce costs.<br><br><br><br>The international market and the domestic market are still not necessarily fully integrated. There are not many export cases and there are certainly not many imports. The main goods of <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipes and valves intended for international trade involve more.<br><br><br><br><span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe fitting analysis<br><br><br><span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe fittings were used internationally and domestically for many years, and they are enduring. Compared with other plastic pipe fittings, there are actually three advantages, one is value, the other is marketing, and the overall application system is by far the most mature. PE pipe fittings, PP pipe fittings and PP-R pipe fittings are greater than <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe fittings with regards to raw materials and manufacturing charges. Especially in the construction associated with drainage drainage and industrial along with agricultural applications, the cost functionality is more obvious. In functional applications, all plastic pipes and <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe fittings would be the most mature and perfect concerning production technology, quality control, construction and installation, accessory connection, promoting technology, and related national benchmarks and specifications.<br><br><br><br>Market research<br><br><br><span class="caps">JUST</span> <span class="caps">ONE</span>. Product market: involving countries and regions on the world. It is understood which the products of similar industry manufacturers are sold to the Middle East, Southeast Asia and other places. The proposal focuses on countries and regions the place that the real estate industry is booming. In addition, the main market for PE-RT floor heating pipes ought to be Russia, Canada and other countries from the colder regions. In addition, it can be crucial to consider whether countries including United States generally adopt fireplace heating to use floor heating facilities. The target market ought to be examined and determined.<br><br><br><br>2. The purchaser group is mainly: wholesaler or municipal engineering project department which could participate in the bidding. Operators are real estate developers, waters companies, sewage treatment plants, normal water conservancy bureaus, power grid corporations, telecommunications companies, municipal projects, and many others.<br><br><br><br>3. Product quality certification essential for export:<br><br>For Europe, if it passes <span class="caps">ROHS</span> certification<br><br><span class="caps">EUROPEAN</span> certification generally has CE, chemical substance tests include <span class="caps">ROHS</span>, <span class="caps">PAHS</span>, <span class="caps">REACH</span>-<span class="caps">SVHC</span>, benzene examination, etc.<br><br><br><br>4. Some conditions or factors that affect the cost:<br><br>First: At the beginning regarding 2008, affected by the northern storm, snow and spring transportation, the shipment of calcium carbide plus <span class="caps">PVC</span> goods was blocked, many <span class="caps">PVC</span> enterprises started to perform lower, resulting in a well-defined decline in <span class="caps">PVC</span> supply and also rising prices.<br><br>Second: The transportation of dangerous chemicals from the surrounding areas of the Olympics has become strictly controlled and the buying price of electricity has been raised, which has led to a significant increase in the buying price of calcium carbide.<br><br>Third: The <span class="caps">PVC</span> industry is really a basic and energy-intensive industry, which can be greatly affected by demand along with energy prices. It is also the basic chemical raw material for your national economy, so it can be very relevant to economic growth.<br><br><br><br>5. Comparison of <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe fittings and other material pipe fittings:<br><br>Compared by using other pipes, <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe fixtures are inexpensive. Compared with metal pipes, the pipe wall is smooth as well as water delivery efficiency is substantial. It can save about 20% with electricity for conveying liquid. While in use, it is light inside weight, easy to install and also requires no maintenance. The make use of steel as a sewage water line for public works, in the procedure of use, due to deterioration, must always apply paint, substantial maintenance costs. The metal pipes for normal construction and public works has to be replaced in about 20 several years, and the <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipes with good processing capacity possess a service life of 50 many years.<br><br>Generally speaking, in terms with sewage, waste water and air flow pipes, <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe fittings save about 16-37% compared fx cast iron pipes; the cost of using conduits is 30-33% compared most of the metal wire casings; Polyvinyl chloride pipes cost 23-44% with regards to hot and cold water than with the same size copper tubes. Hence, due to the advantages associated with <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe, all countries tend to be actively developing and promoting <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe.<br><br><br><br>Our company specializes in this production of <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe fittings. Our <span class="caps">PVC</span> pipe fittings are all in compliance with the standard and you should utilize them with confidence.
