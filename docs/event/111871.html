M= medium (3cu ft.)<br />
L= large (4.5cu ft.)<br />

<p>Two member:</p>
<p>If living in one bedroom apartment will require 4L+ 18M+9S.</p>
<p>If have lots of stuffs like sports gear, office, home, lots of books then this move will probably need 6L+ 36M+9S.</p>
<p>3 member (include one young child)<br />
For one to two bedroom they will probably need 4L+24M+5S, but if have three bedroom then go for 6L+29M+8S.</p>
<p>If you have lots of household stuffs then go for 8L+30M+19S.</p>
<p>Four or more members:<br />
Living simply in two to three bedroom apartments will easily need 7L+ 34M+9S.</p>
<p>Living in three to four bedroom house but will average amount of household stuffs then need 9L+35M+19S.</p>

<p>Amount of household items:</p>
<p>Note this down that amount of household goods vary from people to people because people can be minimalist or a collector. You may have some hobby or indulge in some activities so relatively your goods will be more in amount then the ones who don’t so, for estimating the number of moving boxes you have to think like this-</p>
<p>Bedrooms &#8211; count your linens, dressers, closets and under the bed stuffs.<br />
Kitchen &#8211; simple bachelor will require around 6M boxes and professional foodie will require around 20M boxes.</p>
<p>Living room- How many books, movies, games, desks and files you have.</p>
<p>Bathroom- at least couple of boxes unless you have home spa.</p>
<p>Other- check other stuffs and see your cupboards and closet and then estimate.</p>
