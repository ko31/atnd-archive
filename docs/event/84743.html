Today, it is commonplace to buy all types of consumer products on foreign sites, such as Iphones, laptops or clothes.</p>
<p>It is true that some products are much cheaper in China, Spain, India or the United States but there are sometimes some small inconveniences that are better to know before buying abroad &#8230;</p>
<p>Whether through Ebay, other merchant platforms or online shops, once the order is paid, you will have to wait from one to six weeks to be delivered, sometimes with a passage through the customs and one Painful on arrival!</p>
<p>If you are waiting for a package from abroad, outside the European Union, here are some answers to allow you to wait in complete serenity &#8230;</p>
<p>Stay calm!<br />
Yes, it is true, waiting for a package without having any information on its progress is a real mental torture. That&#8217;s what serve tracked parcels or &quot;  Registered Parcel  &quot;!</p>
<p>The problem is that you have to choose your shipping method at the time of the order, among several proposals, from the most to the least fast:</p>
<p><span class="caps">USPS</span> Express Mail International (<span class="caps">EMI</span>)<br />
<span class="caps">USPS</span> Priority Mail International<br />
<span class="caps">USPS</span> First Class Mail International<br />
Express parcels are relayed to the French border by Chronopost, while the other two types of shipments are processed by Colissimo. The first being the fastest and most reliable of course &#8230;</p>
<p><span class="caps">USPS</span> First Class Mail International Packages are not tracked or guaranteed. It is better to avoid this mode of delivery, except for small consignments worthless.</p>
<p><span class="caps">USPS</span> Express Mail International<br />
For Express parcels, count 5 to 10 working days between the date of shipment and the date of delivery, provided that the shipper has attached all the customs documents in a transparent bag affixed outside the package.</p>
<p>On arrival, Express parcels are virtually systematically checked and taxed by French customs, in particular for any declared value greater than approximately 250 <span class="caps">USD</span>.</p>
<p>Include a 30% to 35% fee on the market value of your package for items corresponding to a 19.6% <span class="caps">VAT</span> rate (<span class="caps">VAT</span> + customs duties + freight forwarding fee).</p>
<p>Taxes and duties are to be paid at the time of delivery.</p>
<p>Priority Mail International<br />
This shipping method is a little cheaper than the previous one and also benefits from the follow-up service but it is especially slower, see sometimes much less fast!</p>
<p>Here, the deadlines are only indicative and it will take between 1 and 6 weeks between the time your parcel has been shipped and the time it arrives at its destination!</p>
<p>Thus, some packages will be delivered in 10 days, others in about 2 weeks and sometimes some packages arrive only after one or two months. More rarely, they never arrive or are returned to their shipper because of the absence of customs documents &#8230;</p>
<p>In addition, as for the Express, you can expect to pay the taxes and customs duties on delivery of your international package!</p>
<p>Internet monitoring<br />
To know where your packages, you can use the following websites, quoting your &quot;  Tracking Number  &quot; or tracking number:</p>
<p>As long as your package is not removed from your home country, you will only be tracked on the <span class="caps">USPS</span> site. When your package is on French territory, you will be able to follow your package on the Chronopost or Colissimo sites, depending on the type of shipment (Express or Priority)</p>
