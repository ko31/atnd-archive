<h3>Talk with the employees</h3>  

<p>You should do the meeting and tell them about the change you are going to plan and the date of it. Don’t forget to assign their works that they need to do within the time table and also make them informed everything like the present address and the locality so that they do the preparation and give their effort to make it successful.

<h3>Establish the budget and purchasing process for the move</h3>

But you have to take a clear idea of the same and can assign the works to a team stating what to do and what they should not. Don’t even forget to explain how they take approval. These smaller things will make the work easier and the shifting will be done outstandingly. </p>

<h3>Make a list of things you need for the new office</h3> 

<p>You should have your list of the things that you want to carry to your new place. Obviously, it helps you to sort those that you want to get rid of. So, do it perfectly and have those with you that will be feasible to carry. When you are sorting the things, you should remember about your budget because this will give you the idea of how much you are free to have the new stuff or it will be good to manage the process whatever you have. Once, you are able to do it well then the preparation is really good. </p>

<h3>Be sure about the workflow</h3>  

<p>You can’t afford the slowdown of the works. So, it will be highly needed to talk with the manager about it and ask them to share how they manage the same. It will be the most important step to take. If there is any deadline for the works that fall in between the deadline, then talking with them and getting the assurance that it will never be missed should be the things to do. So, don’t overlook the same and make this rightly done. </p>

<h3>Create a contact list</h3>
