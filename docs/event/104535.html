<p>My Assignment Services launches an elite assignment help service called My Assignment Services Premium. Analytics predict a 25% growth in the existing customer numbers.</p>
<p>My Assignment Services never leaves any opportunity to amaze their students. And this time they have come out with a <a href="https://www.myassignmentservices.com/premium/">Premium Assignment Writing Help</a> with their mantra of “Assignment Help, Redefined”. The service is set to take a full on effect from 5 March 2019 and is said to be a unique initiative by the organisation. The students are equally excited with the news.</p>
<p>Coming out on the news, Alex Turner, the Marketing Strategy Analyst for the brand, commented “We always work on giving more to the students than simply assignment writing. They can get their assignments done from any assignment help provider online. The question here was what more are we doing, what extra mile are we willing to go to offer the students what no one is. </p>
<p>And students also have a lot to say about this historic move. Inbar, an international student in her nursing postgraduate programme in Adelaide says, “I was already amazed with the service that My Assignment Services was giving. And when I received an email declaring that they are launching a premium service with benefits like choosing your own writer, an exclusive portfolio manager, a 98% guarantee of scoring an HD and others, I am certain that all my assignment are now going to be premium.”</p>
