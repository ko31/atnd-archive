                    <td><p>25 Oct 2018: Students in Australian universities are pouring in from countries all over the world and cultures. This global recognition of Australian universities is the driving force that they are constantly trying to take the standard of the education higher. Hence, it is only human of the students to demand some external help with their assignments. The busy schedule, piling tasks, balancing the university life and their social circle, earn money at their jobs; it is sometimes too much for them. Therefore, there were several assignment writing services that were born of this need. In the past 8 years, My Assignment Services have been a pioneer of this industry and setting the standards for their competitors.<br />
Keeping their services at par with other companies out there, they have decided to set the bar higher for other online assignment services as well. With the advent of technology and the availability of resources, their experts are now more equipped than ever to deliver the high quality assignments that they promise. My Assignment Services have brought onboard the senior officials of National Strategy for International Education 2025 as Expert Consultation Advisors. “With their guidance, we can learn better what the government has planned for the years ahead. While others are focussing on the now, it is important to focus on the tomorrow as well. This is the reason why we are always steps ahead of the fellow members of this industry. Now, we are more capable than before because we can now improve our own standard of operations to incorporate the visions directed by the Australian government for the universities. If the universities are upgrading themselves, it is only important that we too upgrade our services. We do not want what happened to Nokia should also happen to us.”, said Nicole Webber, Head of Domestic Education Services.</p>
<p>Needing online assignment help is just a broad spectrum. However, what My Assignment Services are doing is much more than that. With the inclusion of expert officials on their panel, their services are now setting the competition higher than before. Even students are excited about this decision. A student of Flinders University says, “When they were delivering such <a href="https://www.myassignmentservices.com/">Assignment Writing Services</a> with their standards, they were so good. But now, with the inclusion of officials who are responsible for our entire education system are on their experts’ panel, they are going to become huge. Literally”. Providing only the best of the services at par with what students can get at the price has been the motto of their services.</p>
