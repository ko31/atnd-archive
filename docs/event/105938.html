<a href="https://www.highluxurystore.com"> richard mille replica </a>  The two-second chasing (rattrapante) chronograph has an extra second hand that measures the time interval before it &#8220;catch up&#8221; with another random core running pointer. This complex design is yet another tough feature to create, alongside the tourbillon and the minute repeater.
<p>Shortly after the chronograph was invented in 1822, watchmakers began exploring ways to simultaneously measure multiple events at the same time (intermediate time, relative time, reference time, etc.). The first watch to achieve this was designed by Winnerl in 1831. It has a “monorattrapante” pointer that can be stopped and then immediately chased away when released. time. The two-needle system was introduced in 1838. The two-second chronograph is much more complicated than the &#8220;single-needle&#8221; chronograph. It has a clutch system that can be connected or disconnected from the second-hand pointer and the chronograph main hand. Another unique feature is that they have extra buttons. Pressing this button once will stop the chasing seconds hand, and pressing it again will make the still pointer catch up with the chronograph pointer, so that the two can be combined into one and continue to walk. This operation can be repeated at any point in time and is especially useful in sports involving several competitors. Some chronographs have two or more &#8220;chasing timing&#8221; hands.</p>
<p>Sporty watches are generally equipped with a reversible clockwise bezel. In addition to the modern concept of decoration and symbolic sports life, the bead on the bezel and clear and easy-to-read numbers allow the wearer to accurately adjust diving and sports. Time is absolutely reliable. The outer ring only rotates in one direction, and even if it is accidentally rotated, the remaining movement time will only be shortened, and will not be extended to ensure safety.</p>
<p>In addition to its adaptability and water resistance, the diving watch is far stronger than most watches, and it has other features specially designed for deep sea adventurers and professional divers. <a href="https://www.highluxurystore.com"> brietling watch replica </a></p>
<p>The watchmaker always pays attention to the completely sealed case, but only to protect the movement from dust and moisture in the air. However, in the 20th century, when watches were popular, watches made for divers were already available. The main points of waterproofing are the installation of crystal glass, the back of the case and the crown. In the first two examples, the tightly packed gaskets ensure complete water resistance. The crown is the opposite. Because it keeps moving, it requires more than just a seal. The &#8220;spiral&#8221; crown invented by Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf in 1926 made it possible to make the first truly waterproof watch. Since then, diving watches have become a focus area with impressive development, and the most important reason is the use of the Navy Special Forces.</p>
<p>The diving watch stands out for its excellent water resistance of up to 100 meters, 300 meters, 100 meters or even 3,000 meters. Other features include a one-way rotating bezel to calculate dive time, specially reinforced crystal glass, and a fluorescent scale that provides readability under dark water. They also provide other useful features for deep-sea explorers, such as helium release valves, decompression stops and time indicators, or depth gauges, depending on the level of technology. Some watches can even be prompted by the sounding device to float.</p>
<p>It seems easy to watch the oil process, but in fact, there are many places to notice. First of all, we must confirm whether each part, machine plate and gemstone are clean. The residual dirt must be removed. Otherwise, the effect after the oil is greatly reduced. . In addition, the oil used in Innager watch parts must be special oil, and the oil on each part is different. For example, the power system must use slightly sticky oil (8300 oil), and the gear system is thinner. Oil (8000 oil), the escapement system must use special oil (9010/2 oil), avoid oil in the end, otherwise it will cause serious damage to the Yingnag watch movement.  <a href="https://www.highluxurystore.com"> https://www.highluxurystore.com </a></p></td>
