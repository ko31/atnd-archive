<p>Surely you have Fetlife and most likely you have Switter. In both social networks there are accounts and pages dedicated to <span class="caps">BDSM</span>. On Fetlife it is perhaps less strong, due to the increasingly rigid policy of &#8220;real name&#8221; and the censorship of any erotic photo, but on Twitter there are many accounts that you can follow.

Very complete photo albums<br />

Many members</p>
<p>Weak points :</p>
<p>The terribly outdated interface<br />
Lonely, painful men<br />
A cruel lack of originality (<a href="https://libertic.xyz">https://libertic.xyz</a>)</p>
<h2>Lovoo</h2>
<p>A very useful Lovoo tool for finding interesting people and / or a soul mate is the Radar in the Near You section. By activating it, the application shows you a list of subscribers who are in your immediate vicinity. To get to know them better, you can consult their complete profile in the People subsection. By clicking on each photo, Lovoo tells you where they live and their characteristics and you can show your taste or disinterest with the heart, the &#8220;X&#8221; or by using the IceBreaker.
