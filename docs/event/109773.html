                    <td><p>With all the evolution of new materials for example structural plastics and dietary fiber, manufacturing industries now have several possibilities to design their products. These new materials usually provide performance advantages over classic materials including aluminum, iron and concrete. Overall, material substitution has been a minor factor affecting this demand for these metals during the past decade. However, the importance of substitution by alternative materials will increase in near long run. Surge in demand intended for these materials over metals is usually a major factor slowing down the growth from the global hydraulic press unit market. The performance of any kind of manufacturing industry largely varies according to the growth of their end-user industries. Automotive industry is considered as one of many largest end-user markets with regard to manufacturing technology products. Anticipated growth in that automotive industry over the next few years is likely to aid the manufacturing market to expand globally.
