                    <td><p>01 Nov 2018: Writing case studies have always been despised by the student community, that is no secret. The recent changes in the trends of education and the government’s announcement to introduce a “national interest test” for academics have caused quite a stir among the students across Australia. Also, the government has decided to roll out funds among the academic scholars. However, the restriction of meeting a national benefit test beforehand is something that students are unhappy with.</p>
<p>With this new scheme, the students need to now display a better understanding of concepts and utilise them in their actual research work. What better way is there to develop the students in this direction than assigning them case studies. However, the desire to excel than their peers has made the competition rise a notch above. My Assignment Services, a reliable assignment help provider to Australian students, has come up with a discount of 30% on all case study assignments so that the students can get the academic grades desired at an affordable price.</p>
<p>Dylan Dollar, Public Relations Head for Australia and New Zealand, says, “The government is working for the students, international as well as domestic, there is no doubt about it. But, they need to understand that the students are not machines. We understand the problems a student goes through in his daily routine. Therefore, we have announced an instant discount of 30% for all students in Australia and New Zealand on our case study <a href="https://www.myassignmentservices.com/">assignment help</a>.”</p>
<p>Their services are known well among the students across universities. A wide range of support and assignment writing services, students across Australia rely on and trust My Assignment Services when it comes to assignment writing or getting an expert consultation.<br />
The students have also welcomed this move with a positive response. Bharti, an international student studying in Australia, shares her views, “Getting online assignment help was never easy until I came across My Assignment Services. Trust me, I always rely on their decisions and answers. I don’t remember the last time I failed in any of my assignment. Oh, wait. It was never. I don’t really know much about these tests of the government. All I know is that I can get my case study assignments done for a 30% lesser price and that I all I am excited about!”</p>
