<p>Physics is one of the disciplines in science, which also include chemistry, biology. Physics is the study of various laws of mechanics, laws of electromagnetics, laws of quantum physics and other laws which exist in nature like, why always apple fall on the ground, law of gravitation. Basically, in physics we study the nature of force, electricity, the structure of atom and what are the statics, kinematic, dynamics condition of the body.<br />
Classical physics are being classified into different type’s: -<br />
1. Mechanics<br />
2. Electrodynamics<br />
3. Optics<br />
4. Thermodynamics.<br />
Mechanics is based on the laws of Newton, laws of gravitation which deals with the nature of motion, types of forces act on body, type of constraint act on system, type of body whether it is rigid or deformable and any other physical quantity which describe the property of system.<br />
Electrodynamics is the combination of electro and dynamics i.e. electro means electricity and dynamics means effects, it’s simply an electric effect. In other words, electrodynamics deals with effects that produce due to the combination of electric charge’s and magnetic field. It is based on laws of coulomb and laws of magnetism. <br />
Optics deals with the phenomenon that occur with light, how the light behaves when they interact with matter and what are the various phenomenon occur which describe the nature of interaction like whether it is reflecting, transmitting or absorbing. Optics also describe the nature of light like visible, ultraviolet, infrared and other electromagnetic radiations. It is based on the laws of reflection and refraction.<br />
Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the effect of temperature, heat and conversion efficiency of system. It is concerned with the change of internal energy, enthalpy, the entropy of the system. With the thermodynamics, if make our system more efficient to convert heat into work. The most practical use of thermodynamics is in heat engine, which is used to convert chemical energy of the fuel into mechanical energy. It is based on the laws of thermodynamics.<br />
In this module we cover the Physics-I, which includes the mechanics. Some the topics to be covered in this module is:<br />
1.	Introduction to physical units and measurement<br />
2.	Static and kinematic<br />
3.	Laws of motion<br />
4.	Work, Energy and power<br />
5.	Dynamics <br />
6.	Laws of gravitation<br />
7.	Fluid mechanics<br />
8.	Thermodynamics<br />
9.	Kinetic theory<br />
10.	Oscillation and waves</p>
<p>We provide <a href="https://www.myassignmenthelp.net/science-assignment-help">Science assignment help</a> including physics, will study all this topic one by one from the expert of this subject. We have an expertise in given area domain which makes you easy to understand the basics and later on in-depth knowledge of each topic.&nbsp; Talk to our experts to get <a href="https://www.myassignmenthelp.net">assignment help</a> in physics 24&#215;7</p>
<p>Conclusion<br />
For a science student, it is must to clearly understand the basic laws of nature and physics is one the science discipline where each science student has to learn about the various laws involve in mechanics, electricity, optics and thermodynamics. We will cover the mechanics part of physics by starting a topic on units and its measurements. Then we will cover the statics, kinematics, and dynamic portion of mechanics. Afterward, we go through some basics of fluids and thermal. Then we wrap up this module with the study of oscillation and waves topic.</p>
