<p>Area residents presented those idea and many more during a listening publish on Wednesday night attended by a lot more than 50 people.</p>
<p>Carrie Tysdahl said Clear Lake needs a recreational facility the whole family can use year-round.</p>
<p>She said she has memberships at a gym from the community that has digital cameras, but there&#8217;s nowhere to search with her children in the winter where they could shoot hoops while she walks or runs, or &quot;where you can play together. &quot;</p>
<p>The idea for a community wellness center began because school district needed extra gym space.</p>
<p>Doug Gee, superintendent of Clear Lake Community Universities, recently approached city officials regarding the possibility of the city and also the school working together to develop a wellness center that is going to be used by both students and the public.</p>
<p>Tysdahl said this type of facility also presents a chance for the city&#8217;s parks and recreation department to provide adult leagues for sports just like volleyball and basketball.</p>
<p>Chelsy Snyder said even through summer, when plenty of outdoor recreation opportunities are available in Clear Lake, the weather is usually too hot for small children to be outside.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s built, a wellness center &quot;is going to be utilized year-round, &quot; the girl said.</p>
<p>Some of those on the meeting said Clear Sea needs another indoor mishaps.</p>
