Best free dating app 2019</p>
<h2>1) Tinder</h2>
<p>Tinder (<a href="https://TinderFrance.com">TinderFrance.com</a>) is perhaps the most famous social network in the world and the best free dating app 2019. Very easy to use, it allows the user to browse photos posted by people geographically close. Simply create a profile with a login via Facebook or a new page, upload 4 photos, add a description and select the people you like.</p>
<p>For each profile, photos are presented. The user can decide to give a sign of appreciation (a little heart) or simply to advance by scrolling with his finger. In the metro, at the dentist&#8217;s, lined up at the checkout or on the couch.</p>
<p>When the two people are interested in each other, then the match starts and can begin to chat, go to WhatsApp or maybe meet in person.</p>
<h2>2) Happn</h2>
<p>You know when you see someone on the subway, but you do not know how to get there? Here is why this meeting application is born. Happn (<a href="http://Happn.net">Happn.net</a>)  was born to try to chat with someone who hit us on the street or at a party.</p>
<p>Whenever two people with this app downloaded over the phone meet, the event is recorded and a link is created to let you know when, where and what time you met. When the two people separate, the cat is activated and you can start talking.</p>
<h2>3) DoubleList</h2>
<p>DoubleList is the &#8220;anti-Tinder&#8221; dating application that allows you to see only one profile per day, selected not by the system, but by a team of experts in the field. With Matchmakers, people can understand if the partner is right for you and how good the app is, making it a unique app.</p>
<p>Every day at midnight, both <a href="http://DoublList.net">DoublList.net</a> users will see the proposed photo and can only start a dialogue if they are alike. The fairy tale of Cinderella in digital version. If the spark does not start, wait 24 hours to see the proposed new partner.</p>
<h2>4) Bumble</h2>
<p>Very similar to Tinder because of the research on sliding, Bumble (<a href="https://BumbleApp.net">BumbleApp.net</a>) has however a peculiarity: it is the feminine part to have the reins of the game in hand; that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s considered the ideal dating app for women.</p>
<p>On Bumble, only women can take the lead in engaging conversations, except for same-sex couples (you can change preferences from settings) or people you&#8217;re friends with on Facebook.</p>
<p>The app is free and available for the moment on Android devices, iPad and iPhone with iOS 8 or later. There is no version for Windows. Once installed, you can login via Facebook (from which you take profile pictures and information such as age, date of birth and education), but you must be at least 17 years old for use.</p>
<h2>5) 3nder</h2>
<p>One of the most popular dating apps used by couples and singles for Threesomes, based on location. To start using it, you must register by filling out the form with your email address, password and date of birth, insert a profile picture, and start searching on the map of subscribers close to you.</p>
<p>When creating the profile, you can enter the preferences of the article &#8220;I am looking for&#8221; to help the algorithm show us the people closest to our tastes.</p>
<p>3nder (<a href="http://3nderapp.org">3nderapp.org</a>) is very simple and intuitive to use. It is available for iOS and Android from the respective application stores.</p>
<p>Just look at the user profiles and scroll through their photos to see if they can be interesting and decide to start a discussion. You can send text messages, photos, audio notes, stickers and even your location, as on WhatsApp.</p>
<h2>6) The Inner Circle</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting dating apps at the moment is The Inner Circle (<a href="https://theinnercircle.co">theinnercircle.co</a>), the selective dating platform. It is designed to connect young professionals close to each other and share their experiences, interests and hobbies. The members of the community come mainly from the world of startups and are entrepreneurs, creatives, designers, etc. It is no coincidence that the access to the database of meetings and the validation of the selection are analyzed LinkedIn profiles.

Users can sign up to participate in exclusive events organized in capitals around the world. Inner Circle is available through an app or website. Registration is free and the connection can be established via Facebook or LinkedIn.</p>
<h2>7) JeContacte</h2>

And speaking of Instagram, the Facebook application is increasingly used as a discussion between users who can view a story, a video or a photo to write privately to the person who interests him.</p>
<p>But back to Lovoo (<a href="http://LovooDatingSite.com">LovooDatingSite.com</a>), to find people close to us, you will do nothing more than activate the <span class="caps">GPS</span> function, which will display photos of men or women near our position. Once you have found the right person, via the chat service, you can get to know her better and see if she lives up to our expectations.</p></td>
