<p>Replica Richard Mille RM 002 Pt All Grey 501.48A.91 Watch</p>
<p>Model: RM 002 Pt All Grey 501.48A.91<br />
Manufactured by: Richard Mille<br />
Series :Richard Mille RM 002 Watches<br />
case:platinium<br />
cuts:45&#215;38.30&#215;11,95 mm</p>
<a href="http://www.watchgetluxury.com/replica-richard-mille-rm-052-tourbillon-skull-titanium-watch-p-2045.html"> richard mille skull watch replica </a>  Generally speaking, there are only three places where the watch movement can enter the water: the handle (handle), the watch and the back cover. The waterproof device is also installed in these three places: the apron and the rubber ring, the seal ring, the handle tube and the like, and the rubber ring on the back cover thread edge, and the watch is tight. With these designs, the watch can be waterproof. But can the watch last forever. Absolutely waterproof? No. Originally designed to be absolutely waterproof, but because we have to wind up every time. Need to dial the needle frequently. For a long time, the waterproof ring will be worn and have a gap. The sweat on our neck will also corrode the waterproof rubber ring of the back cover. Even if there is no sweat corrosion, the rubber ring itself will age with time. And loose.
<p>In daily life, it is very common for watches to enter the water. When washing your hands, when it rains, or when you sweat too much, it is possible to make the watch into the water. When the watch is found to be flooded, most people will use a variety of small methods that are circulated on the Internet. After all, they can save time and effort to solve problems and run a repair shop.<br />
However, are these methods really useful? Can you really drain the water inside the watch completely, and it will not affect the movement to cause secondary damage? Not much to say, let&#8217;s take a look at the various small methods that are circulating on the Internet. After the watch enters the water, it is put into the rice. After 24 hours, the water vapor is basically absorbed.<br />
Let&#8217;s not say whether there is any basis. Because the bottom cover and the mirror of the watch are completely sealed, the water vapor can&#8217;t be discharged at all. Therefore, when using this method, the watch handle needs to be pulled out, but the rice has rice dust, which is easy to make. The dust enters the movement and affects the normal operation of the movement.  <a href="http://www.watchgetluxury.com"> patek philippe nautilus replica </a></p>
<p>The watch is worn backwards (the mirror is facing inward, the bottom case is facing outward, and the back is worn on the wrist). The purpose is to let the water in the mirror evaporate by its own body temperature. However, when you understand the internal structure of the watch, you will know that the temperature of the human body alone cannot allow water to escape through the waterproof rubber ring.</p>
<p>It is quite normal for the watch to enter the water. As long as the water is not too serious, the water inside can be removed by various common sense techniques, and the watch will not be damaged. Once in the process of wearing the watch, when the watch enters the water, it should be dealt with immediately, otherwise it will cause more and more serious phenomena.Generally speaking, after the water in the mechanical watch is not serious, a fog will appear in the glass of the watch. Of course, it can be baked by using a high-wattage light bulb, so that in just half an hour. In the time, the water vapor on the glass can be completely removed, which is indeed better in terms of its effect.</p>
<p>When the watch comes in, if the time is too late, and the watch store is close to itself, you can choose to go to the watch store to wipe the special oil. In this case, the parts inside will not be rusted. In effect, it really brings a lot of help.  <a href="http://www.watchgetluxury.com"> http://www.watchgetluxury.com </a></p></td>
