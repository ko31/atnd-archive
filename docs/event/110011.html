                    <td><p>Silicone hose is often a medical silicone hose from the medical field or a new food grade silicone hose throughout food. At the same time, the silicone hose also plays an enormous role in the motor industry.<br><br><br><br>A modern car offers many small parts. Included in this, silicone products occupy a smallish part, such as four tires, high temperature resistant silicone hoses, excessive temperature sealing rings, gas seals, cups, wiper strip, dust covers, backflushing happens to be, and the like. What&#8217;s needed for silicone hose are also high. Because the car might release a lot of heat through the driving process, the general plastic is merely not good, only the high temperature automotive silicone hose can overcome this matter.<br><br><br><br>Product Features: Silicone is a new type of polymer bonded elastic material with outstanding high temperature resistance (250~300 °C) and low temperature resistance (-40~60 °C). They have excellent physiological stability and may be repeated. Repeated unpleasant and disinfection conditions, excellent resilience and long term deformation (200 °C 48 hours only 50%), breakdown voltage (20-25KV / mm), ozone level of resistance, UV resistance. Features like radiation resistance, special silicone provides oil resistance. The silicone hose is traditional, and the steam work would be the direction in which that silicone hose is deployed in the foreseeable future.<br><br><br><br>The automotive silicone hose can be used to transport gas and also liquid silicone products, which are composed of inner in addition to outer rubber layers in addition to skeleton layers. The skeleton layer materials might be polyester cloth, aramid material or polyester cloth. The inner and outer rubber layers in the automotive silicone hose are constructed with ordinary silicone material, oil-resistant hose, plaque created by sugar and alkali resistant, in addition to high temperature resistant motor hose adopts fluorosilicone.<br><br><br><br>As an important part of the car, the automotive silicone hose is distributed from the engine, chassis and physique parts, and plays the particular role of conveying fat, gas, water and transmitting power, and the safety and performance of the car. At present, an automobile needs at least <span class="caps">TWENTY</span> m hose, and the number of hose assemblies for high-class cars has reached above 80H, and there are just around 10 types. There are straight hoses and shaped hoses inside the shape of automotive hoses. You will find high pressure, low pressure and vacuum to the pressure. There are essential oil and water, heat and also heat dissipation, cooling and cooling from the medium performance. There are brake, drive and supercharged tranny types. It has become the representative on the advanced technology of hoses now, and the exhibition halls of various new sorts of hoses are constantly getting into high-tech fields. Structurally, before, various forms such as cloth, weaving, and winding own coexisted.<br><a href="https://www.stdrubberhose.com/Silicone-Hose-pl6399646.html">https://www.stdrubberhose.com/Silicone-Hose-pl6399646.html</a></p></td>
