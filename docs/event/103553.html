<p>There are a lot of people who regard C++ as a time waste language, but they do not get the power that C++ brings with it. It has the feature scope bound resource management (<span class="caps">SBRM</span>), which only C++ is centred about. It acknowledges a full deterministic power to provide high efficiency in the fields of finance, video games and other high performance designated real time systems, manufacture, transportation where precision holds an important factor.
