<h3>Lecture Summary</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Culture in Translation in Early Modern England
	<ul>
		<li>This lecture will consider how modern foreign languages were taught and learnt in early modern England and how the writings of two Protestant language teachers, Claudius Hollyband and John Florio, religious refugees from continental Europe, contributed to these processes. <br />
　　It begins with a look at language lessons in Shakespeare’s play Henry V, which deals with the conquest of the French nation by the English, and the ways in which power is represented through linguistic identity. In this play French is the language of the enemy, the cultural Other, and English the plain language of truth and manhood. <br />
　　But in the sixteenth century many English people did wish to learn French, and also Italian, both for practical purposes of trade and travel and also for broader cultural reasons, especially to acquaint themselves with the literature and thought of countries then considered to be far more culturally prestigious than England, a relative backwater in European terms. On hand to provide this teaching were a number of men who had fled to England for sanctuary from religious persecution in their own countries, and the lecture examines the context within which these men worked, promoting their own languages, as teachers, tutors and writers, enabled by the growth of expatriate Protestant communities especially in the city of London. <br />
　　Over the course of the sixteenth century a tradition had developed of language -teaching manuals written by Protestant refugees, mostly in French, but latterly also in Italian; the first was A Treatise in English and Frenche right necessary and profitable for al young children (1551) by Peter du Ploich, and many more were to follow. The lecture will focus first on the work of Claudius Hollyband whose two textbooks, The French Schoolmaster and The French Littelton became enormously popular and regularly reprinted. The reason for the success of Hollyband’s pedagogical methods and his particular handling of the didactic dialogue, in its mimetic rather than its scholastic form, its uses in conversational practice, will be examined.<br />
　　The achievement of John Florio as a language teacher and cultural ambassador will be compared and contrasted with Hollyband. Florio’s dialogues taught manners and civility as well as foreign languages; he also aimed to introduce his readers to Italian literature. His dictionaries not only introduced new vocabulary, but contributed to the formation and definition of national identity.<br />
　　In conclusion the lecture will summarise the role of language-textbook writers such as Hollyband and Florio, and their contribution to the integration of the English into the culture of European humanism; it will return to Henry V in its emphasis on the contribution of such work to the formation of English nationhood.</li>
