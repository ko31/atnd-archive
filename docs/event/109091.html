                    <td><p>Snakes in a dream usually point to the life force of the Kundalini (the energy that flows in the body, through the channel along the spine, the energy of the chhi flows through it). The Kundalini rises up, awakening the chakras. Mostly, seeing a snake in a dream archetipally means that we are waking up and continuing in spiritual growth.<br />
Tzv. grandmother&#8217;s dream often states that the snake is a dream danger threat etc. Of course, there will probably be some grain of truth in it, and it depends on what we are experiencing in our lives. For example, if we are going to make a deal with a stranger, and it seems to us about a snake that looks too militant to express spiritual growth <a href="https://365daysofpositivity.com/">365 days of positivity</a>, it is quite possible that there was a saying: You are warming the snake on your chest. however, very individual and definitely a snake does not always pose a threat.<br />
Some literature states that the snake means sexuality. I would also be inclined to this view. Sexuality is a force that, in essence, also rises, so it can be partly associated with kundalini.<br />
Their book states that a snake in a dream can mean a desire to control something forbidden. <a href="https://chi-nese.com/spider-dream-extensive-interpretation-and-meaning/">dreams about spiders</a></p>
<p>In the Old Testament, Satan represents the serpent. In a dream it can symbolize the temptation of evil. The snake, as depicted in the Old Testament, is Agent Satan. Rising in the tree represents the serpent of the devil and humbly Eve with the apple of knowledge. This story could be said to be a curse on the animal itself. Satan is a true tempter, but he used the snake as his instrument. Lesson: Even the world&#8217;s strongest and finest animals can&#8217;t resist evil. As a result, the snake has been blamed in history for the fall of Adam and Eve. Since then, in the Bible, the snake is a poisonous character. Even the word &#8220;snake&#8221; is used in Luke&#8217;s book to describe the deadly, subtle and harmful enemy. Snake intelligence is used for evil in the Bible. In dreams it symbolizes fraud, perhaps another person or even a dreamer. Have you ever dreamed of a snake? Yes NoSee results According to psychological theory, the terrible dream of a snake is child trauma. Many people have extreme fear of snakes, so dreams can represent this fear. Fear and anxiety are widely associated with snakes. It may be a child&#8217;s fear, perhaps based on a truly forgotten or forgotten experience. As in real life, snakes can pose a threat, concern, or persistent problem. When snakes reappear in dreams, they carry an important message about the unsolved life problem. Psychologist analysis Parapsychologists say that a snake in a dream represents people we do not trust. Parapsychology is the study of paranormal and psychological activity. According to hay parapsychologists, snakes, lizards and other small, poisonous animals are uncertain and deceptive. These creatures appear in dreams when a dreamer suspects that someone in their lives is untrustworthy, secretly persecuted, unfairly judged, misunderstood or excluded. A breakfaster may feel that he is not expressing his opinion sufficiently. Reptiles may represent a conflict with hyperbole or someone whose behavior is unacceptable to the pickup. Maybe the dreamer is unable or unwilling to behave as another person wants.</p></td>
