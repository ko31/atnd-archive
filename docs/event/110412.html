                    <td><p>Aluminum pipe is a kind of non-ferrous metal pipe, refers to the application of pure aluminum or aluminum metal extrusion processing along its longitudinal length from the hollow metal tubular material. Nonetheless, the use of aluminum tubes isn&#8217;t as simple as it sounds, so you may need lots of guidance. Thus, here comes guide for using aluminum pipes only for you.<br><br><br><br>Here is the subject matter list:<br><br>How Is Aluminum Tube Employed in Compressed Air?<br><br>How Is Aluminum Tube Utilized in Solar System?<br><br>How Is Aluminum Tube Utilised in Heat Sinks?<br><br><br><br>How Is Aluminum Tube Used in Compressed Air?<br>Generally, the compressed air product composed of air compressor, propane storage tank, cooling and drying out machine and filter. The pipe transportation of aluminum tube is ignored by most customers is additionally an important part of the air compressor system. Pipe material selection, design and installation of aluminum tube is quite critical, poor quality material pipe is simple to cause compressed air transmission pipe oxidation rust, air seapage deformation, aging brittle and some other problems.<br><br>At present, in the particular field of compressed air, it is an increasing number of important to replace copper tv with aluminum alloy tube. To be able to save the cost of live materials, it is necessary to be able to replace copper tubes with metal alloy tubes. Through the theoretical calculation in addition to experimental analysis of heat transfer from the air conditioning jacket condenser along with aluminum tube replacing copper tv, the correctness of the theoretical calculation style of heat transfer is verified, along with the heat transfer characteristics are studied. The results show that in contrast to copper tubes, multilayer aluminum tubes include higher energy absorption capacity and also higher energy absorption rate.<br><br><br><br><br><br>How Is Aluminum Tube Employed in Solar System?<br>The solar energy special purpose pipe is each sort of hot water system&#8217;s body water line. With the promotion of the concept of environmental protection and electrical power saving, the solar water heater is a lot more widely used in the arena of heating. And pipeline of fluctuation water of solar power water heater because be placed outdoor for a long time, bear winter cold tide and summer frequent cold difficulties alternates effect, have very high requirement for the strict sex of conduit as well as stability. In view of the special requirements of solar trouble pipes, the performance of aluminum plastic pipes is preferable to that of traditional pipes, which effectively solves the purely natural defects of traditional pipes from the system application.<br><br><br><br><br><br>How Is Aluminum Tube Utilized in Heat Sinks?<br>Compound copper aluminum pipes heat sinks is a kind of copper waterway heat sinks, more by using &#8220;double waterway&#8221; way, although the thickness with the heat sinks increased, but the heat dissipation effect is far more ideal. The optimized convection space can reduce the consumption and cut down the resource consumption under the trouble of equal heat dissipation.<br><br>Compound copper aluminum pipes heat sinks is in other words the copper pipe and aluminum pipe crafted from technological processing precision up to absolve of the heating system high temperature dissipation components, also being component to aluminum tube, heat part is aluminum alloy pipes, copper and aluminum composite heat sinks belongs to the waterways copper heat sinks. In accordance with China&#8217;s compound copper aluminum conduits heat sinks industry standard JG220-2007 &#8220;copper and aluminum composite column type high temperature sinks&#8221; regulation, compound copper aluminum pipes heat sinks does apply to industrial and civil buildings is not really higher than 95 ℃ trouble as heat medium heating technique, PH = 7-12, chloride and sulfuric acid root is only 100 mg/L respectively.<br><br>It sometimes appears that the application of copper-aluminum composite heat sinks is extremely broad, not limited by the oxygen content in the heating system. Our country popularizes the actual compound copper aluminum pipes heat sinks that produces now, below the trouble of high alkalinity water quality, if year corrode rate is actually pressed 0. 005mm/ year examination, can have 50 years of corrosion-resistant fixed quantity of year, leave sufficient room below this condition, also can assure the company life of heat sinks 30 numerous years of above.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The above is use guidance of aluminum tube. Our aluminum products mainly easily use in compressed air system, solar, health equipment, Led lighting housings, furnishings, decoration, heat sinks and several areas, with advanced technology along with a wealth of experience.
