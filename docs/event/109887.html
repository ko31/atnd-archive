However, not all such machines is usually called oxygen concentrator. The reason being different oxygen generators include different principles for generating oxygen.<br><br><br><br>The oxygen generator produces oxygen mainly by following principles.<br><br>Chemical impulse<br><br>Some oxygen generators produce oxygen through chemical outcome. Under certain spatial disorders, these oxygen generators carry out generate oxygen. Because the oxygen inside certain place has increased. However, as the unit is consuming reaction material, it would be prevent generating oxygen soon. You should add reactants for further use.<br><br><br><br>Molecular sieve<br><br>The oxygen concentrator draws in air via a fan or air pump motor. The air after blocking dust and moisture penetrates the oxygen tower. The oxygen tower is filled up with an oxygen molecular filter. The oxygen molecular sieve adsorbs nitrogen if your pressure is increased, so the nitrogen content on the passing air is decreased, and the oxygen content from the finally released gas will be increased. The adsorbed nitrogen gas is often discharged by reducing the particular pressure.<br><br><br><br>According to the principle of the above oxygen concentrator, the oxygen concentrator doesn&#8217;t produce new oxygen, nonetheless it only enriches the oxygen within the air. It should be called concentrator besides generator. This is also the reason why the concentrator and generator will vary.<br><br><br><br>Can oxygen concentrators always be harmful?<br>In terms associated with physical toxicity, the oxygen concentrator is totally harmless because its function is always to enrich oxygen in mid-air, no chemical reaction, no high temperature and higher voltage.<br><br><br><br>From a safety perspective, a qualified and reasonable design is the key to safety when browsing with an oxygen concentrator. Auxiliary functions for instance leakage protection and high-voltage alarms can improve safety during use. In addition, users should use the specification through use. After all, a smaller knife can hurt men and women. If you do not utilize it according to the merchant&#8217;s tip, it may also be unhealthy for you.<br><br><br><br>From a special perspective, oxygen generation opportunities have certain risks. For a lot of people, purifying dust and boosting the concentration of oxygen inside environment will help raise metabolism and make people healthier. However, studies have demostrated that high concentrations of oxygen will make some patients with fragile respiratory tract discomfort, which can cause complications. Although this can be very rare, you should pay attention to it.<br><br><br><br>Do’s and don’ts pertaining to using oxygen concentrator<br> Follow the rules people to make it safer when using an air concentrator. Some basic recommendations can be found for reference. These can be a few more safety tips when using an oxygen concentrator:<br><br>DON’T ever use a great extension cord to plug with your concentrator or plug other things into the same electric outlet.<br><br>DO keep the unit a minimum of 6 inches away from the wall, curtains or other things that might block this filter or prevent air flow circulation around it; this would also help avoid heat buildup (never cover machine with anything either).<br><br>DON’T smoke should the machine is running. It may cause fire.<br><br><br><br>Conclusion<br> The actual oxygen concentrator itself is harmless. It is very safe to work with the oxygen concentrator reasonably. Don&#8217;t worry about this. The oxygen generators produced by our company are developed reasonably and manufactured carefully. At the same moment, we will provide thorough consulting services for our customers.
