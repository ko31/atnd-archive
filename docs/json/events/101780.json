The recent changes in the trends of education and the government’s announcement to introduce a “national interest test” for academics have caused quite a stir among the students across Australia. Also, the government has decided to roll out funds among the academic scholars. However, the restriction of meeting a national benefit test beforehand is something that students are unhappy with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this new scheme, the students need to now display a better understanding of concepts and utilise them in their actual research work. What better way is there to develop the students in this direction than assigning them case studies. However, the desire to excel than their peers has made the competition rise a notch above. My Assignment Services, a reliable assignment help provider to Australian students, has come up with a discount of 30% on all case study assignments so that the students can get the academic grades desired at an affordable price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan Dollar, Public Relations Head for Australia and New Zealand, says, “The government is working for the students, international as well as domestic, there is no doubt about it. But, they need to understand that the students are not machines. We understand the problems a student goes through in his daily routine.
