Electrical engineer Aaswath Raman, with the University of California with LA, has come up which includes a device that can harness energy from a dark night sky to power an \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eLED\u003c/span\u003e — hinting in the new frontier in fast growing energy.\u003cbr /\u003e\nRaman’s findings were published while in the journal Joule today. His device — created from easy-to-find materials including Styrofoam as well as off-the-shelf aluminum parts — takes good thing about radiative cooling, the process which allows objects to release heat following a Sun sets.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe top portion from the device cools down quicker than the bottom, allowing it to turn the temperature swing into electricity by using a thermoelectric generator.\u003cbr /\u003e\nRegrettably, it’s not very potent. The prototype was able to power a white \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eBROUGHT\u003c/span\u003e, but was still a few orders of magnitude less powerful over a solar panel per rectangular meter, as the Periods points out.\u003cbr /\u003e\nUnfortunately, it’s not necessarily very powerful. The prototype managed to power a whitened \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eLED\u003c/span\u003e, but was still several orders of magnitude less powerful over a solar panel per square meter, as the Moments points out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.sunpower-solar.com/products.html\"\u003ewhere to buy solar water heater\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/108789","started_at":"2019-09-16T00:00:00.000+09:00","ended_at":null,"url":"","limit":null,"address":"","place":"","lat":null,"lon":null,"owner_id":337049,"owner_nickname":"lingyuezhang","owner_twitter_id":null,"accepted":0,"waiting":0,"updated_at":"2019-09-16T11:26:17.000+09:00"}}]}
