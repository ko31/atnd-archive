The valve electric device devised by industrial valve inventor is based on the motor power, driving the mechanical reduction gear to transmit power towards valve, valve opening and closing with the final parts, so it may be the core part of electric valve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGas Line Full Bore Flanged Solid Steel Trunnion Mounted Ball Valve\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eList of content for this kind of article：\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Domestic industrial control device inventor\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Universal valve includes low requirements for controlling precision\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. The remote valve manipulate system\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn recent years, every day industrial valve inventor, based to the introduction and absorption of worldwide advanced technology, has been gradually mastered the core technology just like mechanical, manufacturing, and the price superiority, the dominant position inside the domestic market. With the development of industrial automation level, particularly the emergence of fieldbus know-how, the site operation and simple point-to-point control function of electric valve is increasingly difficult to meet the needs of the market.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndustrial valve inventor abroad provides produced fieldbus electric valve products and solutions in succession, but the prices are high. Therefore, improving how much of automation of our country\u0026#8217;s electric valve, modifying the home-based electric valve products, launching its own fieldbus products, improving product competitiveness and consolidating the domestic market and gradually doing international competition are all associated with great significance in joining \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eWTO\u003c/span\u003e these days. industrial valve inventor’s inventing fieldbus features provided distribution solutions for industrial automation and has improved how much of the intelligent field products and autonomy, making the installation and maintenance on the system easier than before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCommon valve has low requirements to get controlling accuracy, operating also currently being simpler with only three reports, open, close and stop. As outlined by industrial valve inventor, under normal circumstances, the operator controls the opening and closing in the valve at the scene over the operation of the valve controller, and the valve opening is indicated throughout the pointer instrument on the valve. In need of protection, the controller in the electric actuators controls on the particular valve stop function under failing condition, but as for that fault diagnosis, it can only count on the operator\u0026#8217;s experience, and sometimes the operator even must open and check, which is admittedly inconvenience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe remote valve control system put forward by industrial valve inventor consists of two levels of control, top and lower. In addition to retaining the initial site operation function, the operator can also make remote operation of valve from the upper machine. PC provides convenient operation with the human-computer interaction interface, supporting for different valves from the system of simple configuration and using database technology to appreciate the valves in the operation belonging to the system status information and problem information management, which facilitates program maintenance. Besides having and cheaper machine communication of fieldbus interface, PC also should have Ethernet interface so as to realize the system and your external information interaction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnder the premise of retaining electrical structure with the original electric actuators, the introduction with the micro controller technology is utilized by embed control system, supporting both on-site operation as well as supporting remote control of \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eDESKTOP\u003c/span\u003e, the two of which is often switched by the switch to the scene. According to industrial control device inventor, lower machine control system improves the detection circuit and field bus user interface, realizing the collection of a variety of fault information in the operation belonging to the valve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.hnvalves.com/products.html\"\u003ehttps://www.hnvalves.com/products.html Industrial Valve\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e201911ld\u003c/p\u003e","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/110404","started_at":"2020-09-30T14:00:00.000+09:00","ended_at":null,"url":"","limit":null,"address":"","place":"","lat":null,"lon":null,"owner_id":336380,"owner_nickname":"bluesky123","owner_twitter_id":null,"accepted":0,"waiting":0,"updated_at":"2019-11-27T16:29:55.000+09:00"}}]}
