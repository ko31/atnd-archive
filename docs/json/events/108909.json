No wonder, why most industrial hubs and factories prefer dry ice cleaning over other methods. Moreover, \u003cb\u003edry ice blasting\u003c/b\u003e can be used in a wide range of situations like cleaning flux off from heavy industrial equipment, circuit boards, sanitation jobs etc. Industries like automotive, printing, aerospace, use this cleaning method over expensive traditional methods. Following are some advantage of dry ice cleaning over traditional one â€“\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eFaster Than Other Methods\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe traditional cleaning methods involve the cleaning equipment to be disassembled and moved to the cleaning location. Moreover, electrical equipment needs to be treated extra cautiously to eliminate any moisture problem. All these make the traditional cleaning processes extremely time consuming. But in case of dry ice cleaningthe equipment is highly mobile and can be cleaned easily in most situations. This makes the process faster and effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eReduced Costs\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike traditional methods, dry ice cleaning involves no cooling down, disassembly, transporting the equipment to the allotted cleaning space etc. Hence, the process is far more economical than other traditional methods of cleaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eCleaning methodology: No Waste Product\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis method does not produce any harmful waste material, thus eliminating the need to cleaning the waste materials again. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.thompsonindustrialservices.com/services/additional-specialty-services/dry-ice-blasting/\"\u003e\u003cb\u003edry ice blasting\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is capable of simply disappears in the atmosphere, leaving behind the contaminants that are to be disposed only. This can again bring down the cleaning costs significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eSafer Than Traditional Methods\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, this method utilizes dry ice to provide efficient cleaning hence there is no safety issue when it comes to electrical equipment. Also, as no chemicals are use, employees face no risks of exposure to harmful chemicals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eNon-Abrasive\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe recycled dry ice used in this method is non-abrasive in nature. Hence it does not damage any sensitive part of the heavy machineries. Instead, through efficient cleaning, it maximizes the life of the machineries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eEnvironmentally Safe\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned earlier, the dry ice cleaning mechanism involves no use of harmful chemicals. It only uses recycled carbon di oxide in the form of dry ice to clean heavymachineries. Hence, the process is environmentally safe and is recycling at its best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, if you are a business owner looking for an efficient cleaning method, opt for\u003cb\u003e dry ice industrial cleaning\u003c/b\u003eto get the best results. It is not only efficient, but also environmentally safe.\u003c/p\u003e","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/108909","started_at":"2019-09-20T10:30:00.000+09:00","ended_at":null,"url":"https://www.thompsonindustrialservices.com/","limit":null,"address":"104 N.
