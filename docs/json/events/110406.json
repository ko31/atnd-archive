The doors and door locks are a key part of the car shape, which can protect the property inside the car and prevent it. Thieves was lost. People have installed car burglar alarm systems for any safety of vehicles, and these anti-theft systems are closely regarding the door locks. Perhaps what you don\u0026#8217;t know would be that the car\u0026#8217;s door locks also make use of wire to wire connectors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKey point:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCar central locking\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWire to wire connector\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ein finish\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCar central locking\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003el Class of car door locks\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are numerous classification methods for automotive electric locks, which can be classified based on the similarities and differences from the main components in the deal with part, or according to the similarities and differences belonging to the coding methods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Push-button digital camera lock: The push-button electronic freeze uses the keyboard or mixture button to input the discover password, which is easy to perform. Internal control circuits often work with electronic cryptographic ASICs. These products include push-button electronic locks plus push-button car ignition locks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Dial-type electronic lock: The dial-type digital lock uses the mechanical dial move to input the unlock program code. Many push-button electronic locks could be converted into dial-type electronic locks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Electronic key type digital camera lock: The electronic key type digital lock uses the electronic key as being the unlocking password. It consists of a unit circuit derived from components, and is made into a small handheld unit in the form of light, sound, electricity or magnetism. Control circuit contact. These products include a group of remote car door locks, steering tresses and ignition locks, as well as electronic code ignition suggestions for getting started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4.

Bio-characteristic electronic lock: Inputs human body biometrics such as sounds and also fingerprints as passwords, and laptop performs pattern recognition control to help unlock and lock, and the intelligence is quite high.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003el Automotive electronic door lock structure\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe control segment includes an encoder, an insight, a memory, a discriminator, some sort of driver stage, an anti-jamming enterprise, a display device, a fuse, and a power supply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLine to wire connector\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAutomotive connectors are a component that electronic engineering technicians often receive contact with. Its role is extremely simple: to bridge the communication concerning the blocked or isolated circuits from the circuit, so that the recent flows, so that the circuit achieves the intended function. The form and structure of the auto connector is ever-changing. It is principally composed of four basic structural elements: contact, housing (depending on the type), insulator, and accessories. In the market, it is also commonly referred to as a sheath, a connector, and a molded case. The wire to wire connector connects different circuits in the application of the door lock, allowing the circuit to circulate to obtain the switching function of the door lock.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ein conclusion\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to facilitate the handling, safety along with other aspects of the car door locks are basically electronic. At this time, most of the electronic locks on the car use central locking. On the other hand, with the increasing complexity in the car door lock mechanism, more and more applications are applied in the actual door lock, and the wire to line connector allows the complicated parts being connected together. It can make your vehicle perform normal anti-theft work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.hrb-connector.com/Wire-to-Wire-Connector-pl504495.html\"\u003ehttps://www.hrb-connector.com/Wire-to-Wire-Connector-pl504495.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e201911ld\u003c/p\u003e","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/110406","started_at":"2021-01-31T14:00:00.000+09:00","ended_at":null,"url":"","limit":null,"address":"","place":"","lat":null,"lon":null,"owner_id":336380,"owner_nickname":"bluesky123","owner_twitter_id":null,"accepted":0,"waiting":0,"updated_at":"2019-11-27T16:32:46.000+09:00"}}]}
