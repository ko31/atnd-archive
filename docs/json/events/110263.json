The \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eEPP\u003c/span\u003e automatic moulding equipment is \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003ePLC\u003c/span\u003e controlled, and its touch-sensing seen \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eMMI\u003c/span\u003e allows easy setting up and selection for moment and process parameters in accordance with requirements of various merchandise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. The \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eEPP\u003c/span\u003e polystyrene moulding machine adopts pressure heating deal with mode, this heating method has supple mentary stability valve control, which can easily regulate steam pressure atoutlet regarding steam valve effectively, and enables control to obtain different outlet pressures on different heating stages through a specific way, so as toin crease stability involving products. It can be adjusted from the user according to his/her demand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. The \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eEPP\u003c/span\u003e polystyrene moulding machine is driven by a hydraulic system, with differential world, stable operation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. The \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eEPP\u003c/span\u003e shape moulding machine includes a pressure feeding system, as well as the user can choose pressure feedingmode determined by process to realize much more sufficient material feeding in to the mold, so as to reduce defective products caused by simply in sufficient material serving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. Steam, compressed weather, cooling water and vacuum blow-off lines are located above orbelow the equipment for easy maintenance, with different color for each line. Of which, the compressed air line will be rectangular pipe above the particular platen, with same color as being the automatic moulding machine with vacuum machine generally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. Distance between the movable mold and fixed pattern is detected with rotary encoder, as well as distance is converted in digitals and shown on the touch screen directly. Feeding interval and various locations of the machine could be adjusted by only adjusting relevant values to the touch screen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. The system of \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eEPS\u003c/span\u003e automatic shape moulding machine has a complete set of wrong doing detection functions. For case: machine safety, overload of motor, and so in, and trouble shooting methods are offered online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. The programmed moulding machine with machine has multiple safety protection devices:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. Motor clog is protected with energy relays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eB. Closing with safety door is covered with proximity switch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eC. In case of engine failure, the computer turns down automatically, and the actual alarm light is ignited up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eD.
