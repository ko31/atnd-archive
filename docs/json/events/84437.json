From the exhibition display to the conference center, from the command center to the stage performing arts, from home to theaters show \u0026#8230; \u0026#8230; the industry as the fourth generation of display technology, high power laser pointer display technology, application development momentum has been overshadowed \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eLED\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eOLED\u003c/span\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\nhttp://www.everyonetobuy.com/super-strong-30000mw-blue-laser-pointer-shop.html\u003cbr /\u003e\nUp to now, the laser display light source has three primary colors of pure laser, phosphor laser, laser hybrid light source (laser and \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eLED\u003c/span\u003e hybrid) three categories, each light source has its own advantages and disadvantages. Contrast, the three primary colors of pure laser advantage is more obvious. Three-color laser is regarded as the most orthodox laser light source. It has the advantages of wide color gamut, high luminous efficiency, long life, low power consumption, good consistency, stable color temperature, safe and reliable maintenance-free and flexible application.\u003cbr /\u003e\nhttp://www.everyonetobuy.com/\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis year, the laser projection display industry is another noteworthy trend is that the application of industry needs, personalized, customized, the overall solution and services to become a new industry to be solved. \u0026#8220;Simple equipment supply has been difficult to meet the needs of users, laser pointers display market is moving from product competition to solution competition.\u0026#8221; Dewey video \u0026#8220;advanced vision\u0026#8221; business executives in the interview said, including Dewey video, including Manufacturers are more concerned about the needs of end users, the search for innovative projection technology to solve the audio and video applications in the complex problems encountered. The difference between the laser display solutions and customized products, is Dewey video for the demand segmentation, the level of the answer after the idea.\u003cbr /\u003e\nhttp://www.everyonetobuy.com/10000mw-blue-laser-pointer-light-cigarette-match.html\u003cbr /\u003e\nBecause the positioning is for the mass consumer market, laser TV received attention than the other members of the laser display family is much higher. Traditional home projector products, brightness, contrast, color and cost constitute a \u0026#8220;performance paradox.\u0026#8221; That is, high contrast and bright environment requires the use of high brightness products, and mercury lamps often means that the high brightness of the decline in color, and the cost of the increase. Therefore, get out of the black house model is the home projector market, the biggest bottleneck. The burning laser pointer products just to overcome this, the formation of the brightness, contrast and color of the three high positions. In 2016, laser TV has become a focus of the TV market. Although it is not the TV itself, but the first to find the size of laser TV and the balance of price, become the first choice for the current home theater. At present, laser TV lineup is also expanding, in addition to Dewey video, optical peak, Hisense, \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eTCL\u003c/span\u003e, Changhong and other traditional TV manufacturers have begun to intervene, which makes laser TV this year or will usher in a new inflection point! , Laser TV popularity of the road is not far away.\u003cbr /\u003e\nhttp://www.everyonetobuy.com/green-laser.html\u003cbr /\u003e\nOver the past year, the laser projection display technology has in the Rio Olympic opening ceremony, G20 variety show, the National Day celebration of Tiananmen Square and other grand events / performing arts highlight debut. Such as super-large-scale activities have been playing the role of black technology testing ground, is also the application of high-tech benchmark. In the domestic and international cultural and entertainment market unprecedented prosperity in the context of laser projection display applications will create a huge market space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the digital display of the venue: in addition to the government\u0026#8217;s livelihood projects museums, planning museums, science and technology museums, art museums, a large number of enterprise exhibition hall and private investment in a variety of museums, forming a huge market demand; Project-driven variety of special display applications; stage performances, light show and other projects after another, are constantly in the green laser pointer projection applications to create a market. In the cultural and entertainment market demand trend, some laser projection enterprises began to actively in the commercial field of business layout, and introduced the corresponding product solutions. For example, the 12,000 lumens 3DLP all-in-one from Dewey Video is an application-level product for stage entertainment, virtual simulation and digital signage markets, theme parks and other scene applications, and for a variety of creative display solutions.\u003cbr /\u003e\nhttp://www.everyonetobuy.com/mini-flashlight-green-laser-pointer-50mw.html\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn the current trend of science and technology, VR / AR is undoubtedly the most popular nowadays, one of the most popular technology applications. The two are even predicted to be following the smart phone, the other is likely to subvert the entire electronics industry, new technologies, new products. In recent years, VR / AR widely used in medical, entertainment, aerospace, film and television, games, social and other fields, and quickly penetrate into people\u0026#8217;s lives. At the 18th Hi-Tech Fair, VR / AR products can be seen everywhere. AR / AR is also a fascinating cutting-edge cross-technology. When the 50mw laser pointer projection display technology and VR / AR achieve the perfect fusion of its application prospects into the winning \u0026#8211; laser projection or will become a catalyst, with which you can enter another brand new environment.\u003c/p\u003e","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/84437","started_at":"2016-12-18T06:30:00.000+09:00","ended_at":"2016-12-20T11:00:00.000+09:00","url":"http://www.everyonetobuy.com/","limit":200,"address":"","place":"Technology Building-26F","lat":null,"lon":null,"owner_id":268556,"owner_nickname":"laserman123","owner_twitter_id":null,"accepted":0,"waiting":0,"updated_at":"2016-12-17T17:35:58.000+09:00"}}]}
