Physics is the study of various laws of mechanics, laws of electromagnetics, laws of quantum physics and other laws which exist in nature like, why always apple fall on the ground, law of gravitation. Basically, in physics we study the nature of force, electricity, the structure of atom and what are the statics, kinematic, dynamics condition of the body.\u003cbr /\u003e\nClassical physics are being classified into different type’s: -\u003cbr /\u003e\n1. Mechanics\u003cbr /\u003e\n2. Electrodynamics\u003cbr /\u003e\n3. Optics\u003cbr /\u003e\n4. Thermodynamics.\u003cbr /\u003e\nMechanics is based on the laws of Newton, laws of gravitation which deals with the nature of motion, types of forces act on body, type of constraint act on system, type of body whether it is rigid or deformable and any other physical quantity which describe the property of system.\u003cbr /\u003e\nElectrodynamics is the combination of electro and dynamics i.e. electro means electricity and dynamics means effects, it’s simply an electric effect. In other words, electrodynamics deals with effects that produce due to the combination of electric charge’s and magnetic field. It is based on laws of coulomb and laws of magnetism. \u003cbr /\u003e\nOptics deals with the phenomenon that occur with light, how the light behaves when they interact with matter and what are the various phenomenon occur which describe the nature of interaction like whether it is reflecting, transmitting or absorbing. Optics also describe the nature of light like visible, ultraviolet, infrared and other electromagnetic radiations. It is based on the laws of reflection and refraction.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the effect of temperature, heat and conversion efficiency of system. It is concerned with the change of internal energy, enthalpy, the entropy of the system. With the thermodynamics, if make our system more efficient to convert heat into work. The most practical use of thermodynamics is in heat engine, which is used to convert chemical energy of the fuel into mechanical energy. It is based on the laws of thermodynamics.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn this module we cover the Physics-I, which includes the mechanics. Some the topics to be covered in this module is:\u003cbr /\u003e\n1.\tIntroduction to physical units and measurement\u003cbr /\u003e\n2.\tStatic and kinematic\u003cbr /\u003e\n3.\tLaws of motion\u003cbr /\u003e\n4.\tWork, Energy and power\u003cbr /\u003e\n5.\tDynamics \u003cbr /\u003e\n6.\tLaws of gravitation\u003cbr /\u003e\n7.\tFluid mechanics\u003cbr /\u003e\n8.\tThermodynamics\u003cbr /\u003e\n9.\tKinetic theory\u003cbr /\u003e\n10.\tOscillation and waves\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe provide \u003ca href=\"https://www.myassignmenthelp.net/science-assignment-help\"\u003eScience assignment help\u003c/a\u003e including physics, will study all this topic one by one from the expert of this subject.

We will cover the mechanics part of physics by starting a topic on units and its measurements. Then we will cover the statics, kinematics, and dynamic portion of mechanics. Afterward, we go through some basics of fluids and thermal. Then we wrap up this module with the study of oscillation and waves topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogin to Our website to get \u003ca href=\"https://www.myassignmenthelp.net/physics-assignment-help\"\u003ePhysics Homework\u003c/a\u003e Help now!\u003c/p\u003e","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/112064","started_at":"2020-03-07T00:30:00.000+09:00","ended_at":"2020-03-30T02:30:00.000+09:00","url":"","limit":null,"address":"","place":"","lat":null,"lon":null,"owner_id":343499,"owner_nickname":"hsmith","owner_twitter_id":null,"accepted":0,"waiting":0,"updated_at":"2020-03-07T20:29:24.000+09:00"}}]}
