Different items need different handling, for example, crystal needs different packaging method when compared to the \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eLCD\u003c/span\u003e Television. Your chosen \u003cstrong\u003eMovers and Packers\u003c/strong\u003e may need to consider a lot of basics before applying reinforcement so that they don’t move from their place while loaded on the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e​Pay close attention if you are moving long distance when you are required to be extra cautious to prevent precious items from potential damage. Most common issues with \u003cstrong\u003efragile items\u003c/strong\u003e may be vibration and shock while in transit. This might happen under various circumstances, like shaking heavily if the box is placed right above the wheels or the box getting dropped due to sudden braking, or driven over a segment of rough road when being transported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet your larger items wrapped by corrugated sheets and wrap a layer of film sheet over as reinforcement. Place these items in the box and use shredded paper between each section for layering the items.  For crystal, don’t use newspapers because the ink might stick on them which is difficult to remove.  It can also ruin porous items like clay pots and antiques. Using towels, blankets or bed sheets for protection is recommended only for short distance moves. This might consume most of the space in a box or may aid to develop cracks in the glassware due to compression. Therefore, \u003cstrong\u003epackaging material\u003c/strong\u003e used for cushioning and reinforcement should protect from all kinds of shocks and vibrations and do not harm the items from potential transit damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEfficient packing materials for fragile items include;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavy grade of brown packing sheets to wrap around the effects to provide extra cushioning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBubble wraps to provide reinforcement around the object\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorrugated sheets which are made from fluted board with right amount of thickness to provide the required protection\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFoam sheets that are specifically meant to fit around a particular object for optimum cushioning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAir tight packaging foils which are designed to fill the gaps within a box to protect the objects from the sides of the box to withstand multiple shocks while in transit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe right sized box that the \u003ci\u003eMovers and Packers Hyderabad\u003c/i\u003e bring for the job is 1.5 feet x 2 feet which weighs 20 kgs when full.
