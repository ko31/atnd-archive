Today let\u0026#8217;s take a look at the aluminum tube painting process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is the actual content list:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDefinition Connected with Aluminum Pipe Drawing Technological innovation\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClassification Of Aluminum Tube Drawing Technology\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdvantages Regarding Aluminum Pipe Drawing Technological know-how\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDefinition Of Aluminum Pipe Drawing Technology\u003cbr\u003e Aluminum tube drawing technology is some sort of plastic processing method, which uses the alternative force to act within the front end of that drawn metal, and then pull the metal blank out from the die hole inside the section of the write off, so as to obtain corresponding shape and size of the aluminum tube. Because drawing is normally done in a cold state, it is referred to as cold drawing or cool drawing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring drawing, your aluminum tube will deform along with its original shape and also size will change. On the other hand, the volume of that aluminum tube is virtually constant During metal plasticity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore advanced than extrusion, rolling, forging and various processing processes, the drawing process is realized through the use of a pull force to the front end of the particular processed metal, which known as drawing force. The ratio of the drawing force to the cross-sectional class of the drawn metal with the die outlet is called the system drawing force, or enter stress. The drawing stress ought to be less than the yield strength of the metal die, if here is your chance stress is too big, more than the yield strength in the metal die, can induce the aluminum tube appear thin neck, or perhaps break.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClassification Of Metal Pipe Drawing Technology\u003cbr\u003e Strong drawing mainly includes tavern, profile, wire drawing; Hollow attracting mainly includes tube and also shaped hollow drawing. Our common cold pulling aluminum tube belongs towards the latter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmong them, you will find the following methods intended for tube drawing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSinking pulling\u003cbr\u003e During drawing, no core head is placed inside the billet, when i. e. no core head is drawn. The main purpose could be to reduce the diameter on the billet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter drawing, the wall thickness on the pipe will generally alter slightly, either increase or perhaps decrease. After many times of sinking, the inner surface belonging to the pipe is rough and cracks will occur when it can be serious. The sinking method is suitable for drawing small size aluminum tubes, special-shaped aluminum tubes, as well since reducing and shaping small diameter aluminum tubes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProlonged core drawing\u003cbr\u003e The aluminum tube billet is set freely on the area polished core rod, as well as the core rod and your aluminum tube billet are pulled from the die hole together to obtain diameter reduction and divider reduction. This method is known as long core rod drawing. The length of the mandrel will be slightly greater than the length of the aluminum tube after drawing. After the primary drawing, the mandrel will probably be removed by either the stripping or rolling technique.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong core rod drawing is characterized by way of a large processing rate, as much as 63%, but due into the need to prepare a variety of diameters of long core rod and raise the tube stripping process, usually this kind of is rarely used in production, it is suited to the production of thin-wall metal tube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFixed core travel drawing\u003cbr\u003e The core fishing rod with core head is definitely fixed during drawing, plus the pipe blank can lower diameter or wall as a result of die hole. The surface quality on the aluminum tube drawn together with fixed core head surpasses that of sinking sketching aluminum tube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis method is most widely used in the production connected with aluminum tubes, but drawing thin-wall aluminum tubes is definitely difficult.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdvantages Of Light weight aluminum Pipe Drawing Technology\u003cbr\u003e \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eONE\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003ePARTICULAR\u003c/span\u003e. The drawing aluminum tube is accurate in space and smooth in surface area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Drawing is best choice for continuous high-speed manufacturing of long products with microscopic cross sections. The wall thickness belonging to the drawn aluminum tube is often as thin as 0. 5m.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eSEVERAL\u003c/span\u003e. Drawing production tools plus equipment are simple, easy to accomplish maintenance. In a same equipment we can produce a considerable amount of specifications and varieties involving aluminum tubes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn your immediate future, we will devote ourselves to the introduction of new drawing technology in addition to new drawing theory pertaining to aluminum tubes, so as to save energy, material, boost product quality and production. If you want that will cooperate with us, you should not hesitate.
