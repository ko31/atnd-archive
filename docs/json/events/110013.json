High force will all together produce elastic deformation in the interface of the slewing get and mounting structure. This deformation can also cause meshing problems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e路lubricating\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe three influencing factors mentioned will bring about high peak loads acting to the edge of the pinion tip, which may cause this lubricant film to rupture and direct metal contact will increase the chipping effect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eXuzhou Wanda Slewing Displaying Co.,Ltd. is a professional manufacturer and exporter connected with slewing bearing, which are mainly applied in vent machinery, mining machinery, welding devices, construction vehicles, modular motor vehicles and small wind electric power systems etc. Slewing having can bear axial push, radial force and tilting minute. The diameter range of slewing bearing you can easliy provide can be via 200 mm to 5000 mm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.slew-bearing.com/SLEWING-BEARING-pl502823.html\"\u003ehttps://www.slew-bearing.com/\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eSLEWING\u003c/span\u003e-\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eBEARING\u003c/span\u003e-pl502823.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/110013","started_at":"2019-12-03T00:30:00.000+09:00","ended_at":null,"url":"","limit":null,"address":"","place":"","lat":null,"lon":null,"owner_id":337049,"owner_nickname":"lingyuezhang","owner_twitter_id":null,"accepted":0,"waiting":0,"updated_at":"2019-11-11T02:16:55.000+09:00"}}]}
