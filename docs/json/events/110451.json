","catch":null,"description":"\u003cp\u003eThe first advantage of the \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eIPTV\u003c/span\u003e technology is that it allows to share the interface with other applications: Internet access, voice over the Internet \u0026#8230; Its appearance has made possible the marketing of triple play offers present today at all the operators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other technical advantage, and this one is far from being negligible, is the optimization of the bandwidth. Indeed, unlike a conventional broadcast or satellite network, \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eIPTV\u003c/span\u003e allows to distribute only programs selected by the user. This is a major difference! Let\u0026#8217;s explain: this is how it works, at least in principle. The classic network broadcasts all of its programs to each user. It\u0026#8217;s at the reception that everyone chooses their program locally, thanks to their decoder. Conversely, \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eIPTV\u003c/span\u003e retains its available content, but only broadcasts what the user chooses: not only does this free up bandwidth, but it also does not limit the user\u0026#8217;s choice of capacity of its means of reception: nothing prevents to watch a film of 800Go with a hard disk of only 200Go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, over time, more and more efficient encoding and decoding systems (the \u0026#8220;codecs\u0026#8221;) have also made it possible to optimize bandwidth consumption. The IP network was able to broadcast more content and allow new features. Finally, \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eIPTV\u003c/span\u003e has the native feature of a real interactivity between the server and the user, which has made it possible to develop many applications impossible to achieve before its appearance. Some examples that everyone already knows:\u003c/p\u003e\nthe interactive program guide, as well as the function that allows the user to search by title or actor\nthe \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003ePIP\u003c/span\u003e function, that is to say, Picture in Picture, which displays a second channel inserted in the same television screen\nthe function allowing the viewer to choose the angle of the camera or the language broadcast for certain programs\nfinally, all the features directly related to the transmission via internet, such as access to music and photos stored on a tablet or laptop, the use of a mobile phone to program the recording of a program or set parental control.\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, this list is not exhaustive, your \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eISP\u003c/span\u003e making a point of honor to constantly develop new possibilities. However, at the point of convergence between smartphone and television, there are also alternative offers to the usual ISPs for an \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eIPTV\u003c/span\u003e subscription: Apple TV, Android TV and the famous Google Chromecast \u0026#8230; not to mention Smart TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eIPTV\u003c/span\u003e beast\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way you watch TV has not changed much in 30 years.
