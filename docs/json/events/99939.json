This is why graphic artists have long turned to XP-Pen pen tablets for editing digital photography and digital art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor photographers and graphic artists who haven\u0026rsquo;t already embraced the idea of a pen tablet or tablet PC, the appeal of the XP-Pen G640S is that it is a full-featured \u0026quot;graphics tablet.\u0026quot; Tablet PCs offer a great deal of flexibility and a range of practical applications; leading to their popularity with artists and other creative professionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo recently I\u0026rsquo;ve purchased the XP-Pen G640S \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eUSB\u003c/span\u003e Pen Tablet. I\u0026rsquo;ve bought this nice piece of gear with the intention of being able to expand the way I use the cursor to select things on my computer. For some people, that may mean being able to draw more naturally, write digitally instead of using the keyboard, for playing \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eOSU\u003c/span\u003e professionally; and/or acting as a mouse replacement for the ergonomic benefit, preventing/letting carpal tunnel to heal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also imagined that a graphics tablet would help me in video or photo editing. Video or photo editing can require an immense amount of time and concentration, and using a mouse in such a rigid fashion can lead to complications like strain, \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eRSI\u003c/span\u003e, carpal tunnel, among other things. Whereas using a tool like a pen tablet feels more natural to use in the hand without putting strain on your wrist. And for this reason, there are many people who use a graphics tablet like the XP-Pen G640S as a total replacement to the common mouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe point at which I realized the true value of the tablet is simply when I started seeing how much faster I can edit faces with the pen tool. Because the tablet has a relative positioning attitude (so your tablet is mapped to your screen, and a specific point on the tablet will always be the same point on the screen) you tend to be able to move to exact locations on XP-Pen tablet surface image and edit out blemishes much faster than with a mouse. Also, changes made with a Photoshop tool that requires a natural flow along the lines of your object (like a face) is just so much easier to do well with a pen or stylus than with a mouse. I would not be over-exaggerating to say that it has cut editing time in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blogscat.com/drawingtablet\"\u003ehttp://blogscat.com/drawingtablet\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://drawingtablet.strikingly.com\"\u003ehttp://drawingtablet.strikingly.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://drawingtablet.blog.bbiq.jp/best_xppen_drawing_tablet\"\u003ehttp://drawingtablet.blog.bbiq.jp\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://drawingtablet.e-monsite.com/\"\u003ehttp://drawingtablet.e-monsite.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://drawingtablet.smackjeeves.com/news-archive/posts/154607/best-drawing-monitor-tablet-xp-pen-artist-22e-for-designers/\"\u003ehttp://drawingtablet.smackjeeves.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://drawingtablet.qsite.dk/227932/XP-Pen%20G640S%20Review\"\u003ehttp://drawingtablet.qsite.dk/227932/XP-Pen%20G640S%20Review\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.merchantcircle.com/blogs/xppen-hammonton-nj/2018/8/XP-Pen-G640S-Graphic-Tablet-Review-Design-for-OSU-Signature-signing/1555079\"\u003ehttps://www.merchantcircle.com/blogs/xppen-hammonton-nj/2018/8/XP-Pen-G640S-Graphic-Tablet-Review-Design-for-\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eOSU\u003c/span\u003e-Signature-signing/1555079\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tabletsdrawing.blogspot.com/2018/08/xp-pen-g640s-graphic-tablet-review.html\"\u003ehttps://tabletsdrawing.blogspot.com/2018/08/xp-pen-g640s-graphic-tablet-review.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tabletsdrawing.wordpress.com/2018/08/27/xp-pen-g640s-graphic-tablet-review-design-for-osu-signature-signing/\"\u003ehttps://tabletsdrawing.wordpress.com/2018/08/27/xp-pen-g640s-graphic-tablet-review-design-for-osu-signature-signing/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://graphicstablet.quora.com/XP-Pen-G640S-Graphic-Tablet-Review-Design-for-OSU-Signature-signing\"\u003ehttps://graphicstablet.quora.com/XP-Pen-G640S-Graphic-Tablet-Review-Design-for-\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eOSU\u003c/span\u003e-Signature-signing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/graphicspad/journal/XP-Pen-DECO-02-Digital-Art-pad-Review-test-761637098\"\u003ehttps://www.deviantart.com/graphicspad/journal/XP-Pen-\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eDECO\u003c/span\u003e-02-Digital-Art-pad-Review-test-761637098\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drawingtablets.tumblr.com/post/177439384459/xp-pen-g640s-graphic-tablet-review-design-for\"\u003ehttps://drawingtablets.tumblr.com/post/177439384459/xp-pen-g640s-graphic-tablet-review-design-for\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/99939","started_at":"2018-08-22T01:00:00.000+09:00","ended_at":"2018-09-14T02:00:00.000+09:00","url":"","limit":null,"address":"","place":"","lat":null,"lon":null,"owner_id":317945,"owner_nickname":"xppen","owner_twitter_id":null,"accepted":0,"waiting":0,"updated_at":"2018-08-29T19:05:48.000+09:00"}}]}
