When you unpack your furniture and appliances and you see something is broken, who do you call? The packers and movers won’t respond and even if they do, they will shrug off the damage or deal with the issue in a brutish manner. With well-established movers and packers, you’ll see that they have a dedicated customer care helpline and they will attend to your issues professionally. This customer-centric approach will make you feel valued and you’re sure to get value-for-money services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDISTANCE SHOULD NOT MATTER\nIt doesn’t matter if you need to move 500mts or 500 km. Your movers and packers should be able to offer you the same unbeatable services in both cases. If you choose an inexperienced team, they assume that for short distances you don’t need to worry about the materials used for packing. This is a huge mistake, no matter what distance you need to move, your items still need to be protected with the highest quality of packing materials. Accidents could happen right outside your door, and the only thing that can protect your items is how it’s packed and what its packed with.\u003c/p\u003e\n","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/110748","started_at":"2019-12-09T01:30:00.000+09:00","ended_at":null,"url":"https://www.moversandpackersonline.com/our-process/","limit":null,"address":"DDUTTL, Yeswanthpur, Bangalore","place":"Safety Cargo Movers And Packers","lat":"13.022314","lon":"77.53514799999999","owner_id":340562,"owner_nickname":"Safety Cargo Movers And Packers","owner_twitter_id":null,"accepted":0,"waiting":0,"updated_at":"2019-12-10T02:44:51.000+09:00"}}]}
