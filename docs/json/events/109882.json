It plays an exceptionally important role in pets, and all farm animal owners cannot forget to supplement their animals with copper feast additives. Moreover, copper is one of the most easily missing components, so it should often be paid more attention and added over time. This article will explore the trace element photographer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis article contains this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTransport metabolic process\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUse of trace element office assistant\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMatters needing attention\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1、Transport fat burning capacity\u003cbr\u003e Transportation of copper within the blood\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrace element copper is mainly absorbed in the small intestine comprising a stable chelate. Right after copper enters the body, copper is used as being a transport tool, and cells take copper from ceruloplasmin. Another route of transmission of copper could be to bind to albumin histidine inside plasma and enter this cell through free ion channels around the surface of the cell phone membrane.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCopper transport to the cell membrane\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome people mistakenly believe trace element copper can enter the cell for metabolism only from the above two channels. Significantly, it has been observed that copper converts divalent office assistant ions into monovalent copper ions by cell surface reductase Frel/Fre2 in advance of entering the cell, and enters the cell as being a monovalent copper ion. Inside the study of yeast truck driver ion transport, it was found that there are particular transporters of copper around the cell membrane of abolish \u0026#8211; Ctrl and Ctr3, that are specific and stable to the transport of copper ions. It was before later discovered that this copper-specific transporter, the coppertransporter protein, can be present on mammalian personal membranes to transport monovalent copper from outside the cell for the inside of the cell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCopper excretion\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcretion of copper is accomplished by bile secretion, plus the amino acids in the bile are joined with copper and excreted in the feces. A small part is excreted from the intestinal wall and a smaller amount is excreted by urine. Both feces and copper from the urine are complexes connected with proteins. In addition, an exceptionally small part of this copper is excreted because of the sweat glands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2、Application involving trace element copper\u003cbr\u003e To be a feed additive, trace element copper is normally represented by the compound copper sulfate. Appearance is usually blue or blue-green amazingly, no visible foreign harmful particles. The application in a crowd of animals is both incomplete as follows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdding appropriate quantity of copper sulfate feed additive to pig feed can improve the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the feed, antibacterial growth and promote growth hormone secretion. High copper feed tend to make piglets resistant to diarrhea in addition to grow faster. The a stool is black.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe add-on of copper sulphate feed additive to chicken supply promotes bone development in addition to improves feather pigmentation, controls blood vessel elasticity, helps bring about iron synthesis of heme, and also promotes red blood cell maturation. If there is often a lack of copper while in the chicken feed, it will cause anemia and abnormal our bones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrace element copper may be the most easily deficient mineral element within the feed of cattle as well as sheep. Phosphorus deficiency in cattle and sheep may cause ataxia, hair discoloration, cardiovascular system disease and low libido.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSika deer feed and also copper feed additive can improve the digestive function of sika deer gastrointestinal area. Adding copper can enhance the digestion ability of protein, phosphorus and also fiber. The suitable addition a higher level copper in the supply season is 15-40mg/kg. This amino acid content was 40 mg/kg.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3、Matters wanting attention\u003cbr\u003e Animals of several ages have different quantities of absorption of truck driver feed additives in diet plans: adult animals absorb about 5% to 10% connected with copper in diets, along with young animals reach 15% to be able to 30%, while weaning Lambs can absorb as long as 40% to 65% involving copper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePay attention to as much addition, excessive addition of this product will cause photographer poisoning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe addition of copper in the feed will promote the particular oxidation and rancidity of unsaturated efas, while vitamins have your destructive effect, should be noted taking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe copper content from the feed is too large, will cause copper accumulation in the liver of the animal, may have adverse side effects on human consumption\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReally should be stored in a nice, dry place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrace element copper feast additives are indispensable because they play an extremely important role in animals. If they may be lacking, they will possess serious consequences. Of lessons, too much enrichment may cause a series of wounds. The importance of copper feed additives is not only important in itself, but its means of use is also crucial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.polifar.com/Trace-Element-pl78478.html\"\u003ehttps://www.polifar.com/Trace-Element-pl78478.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/109882","started_at":"2019-12-04T01:00:00.000+09:00","ended_at":null,"url":"","limit":null,"address":"","place":"","lat":null,"lon":null,"owner_id":337049,"owner_nickname":"lingyuezhang","owner_twitter_id":null,"accepted":0,"waiting":0,"updated_at":"2019-11-05T11:59:39.000+09:00"}}]}
