There are a number of men\u0026#39;s watches with very versatile designs and case sizes that can be easily incorporated into a woman\u0026#39;s wardrobe. But with many women\u0026#39;s watches now evolving into something a little more unisex (such as less diamond-studded and larger cases), there are actually a lot of Rolex watches for women that we think men would also like to wear, so today we\u0026#39;re taking a a closer look at some of our top picks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRolex Yacht-Master 116655 Everose\nNow that we have solved the problem that it is \u0026quot;pink\u0026quot;, the unique look and feel of this watches replica is something every watch collector would love to put on their wrist. The juxtaposition of that luxury Everose gold against the sporty black matte Cerachrom bezel and the matching black rubber (titanium-lined) Oysterflex band turns out to be iconic and completely unisex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile technically classified as a men\u0026#39;s model rather than one of many women\u0026#39;s Rolex watches, the 40mm sizing means this Everose Yacht-Master looks at home on wrists of all sizes and gender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRolex Yacht-Master 116622 Rolesium\nJust like the Everose gold Yacht-Master on our list, this is actually a men\u0026#39;s watch. However, this Rolesium Yacht-Master has received special attention from the ladies because of the stylish combination of sturdy stainless steel with luxurious platinum. The case and bracelet are made of 904L steel, but the ring and dial of this watch are made of https://www.replicamagic.nl vibrant 950 platinum, which gives this timepiece a unique sporty and elegant look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRolex Daytona 116505 Everose\nThe Everose gold Daytona ref. 116505 is one of the most striking Daytona models ever produced - the entire case, dial, bezel and bracelet drip in Rolex\u0026#39;s patented pink-tinted alloy. To contrast this, Rolex used black indexes on the dial and bezel, as well as the sub-dials in black. It\u0026#39;s a masculine juxtaposition that\u0026#39;s also pretty cool and contemporary, and it looks great on your wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/112215","started_at":"2020-03-30T03:00:00.000+09:00","ended_at":null,"url":"","limit":null,"address":"","place":"","lat":null,"lon":null,"owner_id":343917,"owner_nickname":"replicawatches","owner_twitter_id":null,"accepted":0,"waiting":0,"updated_at":"2020-03-30T16:54:30.000+09:00"}}]}
