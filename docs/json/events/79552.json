These drive change in the direction we want based on our internal motivation, instead of just reacting passively to outside forces. Create a team that will proactively innovate and execute whilst sharing best practices to ensure that we all win. Use situational leadership techniques for energizing and motivating your team to action, based on how skilled, experienced and confident they are for each topic. For example, delegate to the leaders, coach the future stars, and support the moderately experienced.  Also, help members learn their personality types and team combinations so they can mutually support each other. And coach them 1-1 so they focus on achieving their dreams at hot same time as the company’s goals.\u003c/p\u003e","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/79552","started_at":"2016-07-14T19:00:00.000+09:00","ended_at":"2016-07-14T21:30:00.000+09:00","url":"http://jglobalinstitute.org/glplaunch/","limit":null,"address":"1-7-20, Yeasu, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 102-0038","place":"Yaesuguchi Kaikan B2","lat":"35.6811492","lon":"139.7699695","owner_id":253590,"owner_nickname":"J-Global Institute of Collaboration","owner_twitter_id":null,"accepted":0,"waiting":0,"updated_at":"2016-07-12T15:49:04.000+09:00"}}]}
