It is a few related field and subprojects, and a variety of these results. Because on the rapid development of that plywood industry, its knowledge and experience are updated within weeks. Therefore, the production technology planning of an plywood enterprise usually requires a team with many professional abilities to perform it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlywood whole grow intelligent planning generally split into several stages. Each stage should have solid foundation work, each stage and stage achievement really should be generated report as the basis in the next stage, the report involves basic data research, economic analysis, management examination and factor analysis, etc. The layout of the production line ought to be the inevitable result, based on a number of data analysis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlywood whole plant intelligent planning can make plywood production more efficient, and can effectively minimize the production cost, and help factories to establish a basic process direction system, lay the foundation with the factories of self-improvement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo accurate strategic objective, going soon after high level aimless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the present time, many factories ask to get more intelligent, numerical control machines, robot and industry \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eFIVE\u003c/span\u003e. 0. Some big scale plywood factories blindly purchase a large number of numerical control equipment, for instance robots equipment used within plywood production. It doesn\u0026#8217;t adapt with enterprise development reality, will be nonproductive and waste.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost belonging to the domestic plywood manufacturing level is low and the management of enterprises is relatively weak. The basic framework associated with modern industrial production will not be perfect,.It is hard to succeed in 4. 0 industrial in this case. For example, a lot of plywood factories have not any complete process drawing pertaining to plywood, also does not have the modern technological style and design team (most companies comprehend plywood process design when down the list), the team will give difficulty to operate a new automated plywood factory, therefore industrial 4. 0 is nothing with this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe numerical control apparatus for plywood production, specially the \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eCNC\u003c/span\u003e equipment connected with plywood, can only complete a number of types and special varieties of plywood, not be all-purpose. And background maintenance and also the design of machine action programs need more demands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing robot application in plywood industry must also be careful, for a particular plywood products and instances, the robot can may play a role. But in much plywood factories, the robot cannot change human work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.chinachangxing.com/Veneer-Drying-Machine-pl6230806.html\"\u003ewhere to order Veneer Drying Machine\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","event_url":"http://atnd.org/events/110009","started_at":"2019-12-03T01:00:00.000+09:00","ended_at":null,"url":"","limit":null,"address":"","place":"","lat":null,"lon":null,"owner_id":337049,"owner_nickname":"lingyuezhang","owner_twitter_id":null,"accepted":0,"waiting":0,"updated_at":"2019-11-11T01:49:37.000+09:00"}}]}
