The main ambition of writing these types of tests is to mimic user actions to determine if the web server and database are behaving as expected as they carry out the users’ commands. Documents are the heart of selenium tests. These commands are a way of knowing what part of the application is being tested and what the user expects the browser to present. Writing tests is almost simple with selenium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end product of a selenium test can be transformed to any language, however, by default, selenium scripts are simply a combination of “Selenese” commands in an \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eHTML\u003c/span\u003e format. However, by creating or downloading a user extension, JavaScript commands may also be implemented. User extensions themselves are created with JavaScript by adding methods to the Selenium object prototype. More insights of this automation testing can be gained from Selenium training through online learning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout TekSlate:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTekSlate is the globally professional in IT courses training which emphasizes on hands-on experience with examples from real-time scenarios by experts.
